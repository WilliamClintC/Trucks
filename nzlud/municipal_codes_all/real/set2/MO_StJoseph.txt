If any person or other entity has had an ownership or similar interest in any active or inactive closely held business or other enterprise that owes any identified delinquent city taxes incurred during the time when that person or other entity participated in management of the closely held business or other enterprise, then no license or permit provided for or required by this code or any ordinance of the city shall be issued to that person or other entity for any reason until the business enterprise's identified delinquent taxes and sewer use charges that were incurred during the time when that person or other entity participated in management of the business or other enterprise, are paid.

(d) Reasonable efforts to identify delinquencies. For the purposes of this section, permit clerks and other issuers of licenses and permits are not required to make more than reasonable efforts to identify delinquent amounts owed to the city, as such efforts are defined by the person’s department director, division manager, or other person in a similar supervisory role.
(e) Exceptions. In the event any person or other entity requests a license or permit in order to complete work in compliance with a notice or order issued by the city for work to be completed on rights-of-way or other public land, the person or other entity may present the notice or order to the permit clerk or other issuer of the permit or license and a license or permit may be issued although such issuance would otherwise be prohibited by this section.

Unless otherwise provided in an unexpired agreement, licensee shall also be responsible for interest on all amounts owed and at a rate of one and one-half percent per month.

The council may, by ordinance, adopt any such plat, provided that notice of the time and place when and where it will be considered for final passage shall be sent by mail to the record owners of the land on or abutting which the future street lines designated on the plat are located. Any modification of such plat shall, before passage, be submitted to the planning commission for approval or disapproval before submission to the council.

(1) All public streets existing and established by law at the time of the establishment of the official map.

(d) After the official map is established, all street locations on final or recorded plats of subdivisions approved by the planning commission on plats adopted by council shall be deemed additions to or modifications of the official map and shall be placed thereon. The council may, by ordinance, make, from time to time, other additions to or modifications of the official map by placing thereon the location of proposed streets, street extensions, widenings,

narrowings or vacations, provided that notice of the time and place when and where such additions or modifications will be considered for final passage shall be given as provided by ordinance to the record owners of the lands on or abutting which such mapped streets or street lines or street vacations are located. Any such proposed addition to or modification of the official map shall be referred to the planning commission for its approval or disapproval, but if the planning commission fails to act within 30 days, the council, by a majority vote of its members, may pass such amendments.
(e) The council may provide by general ordinance that no permit shall be issued for any building or structure or any part thereof on any land located between the mapped lines of a street as shown on the official map. Any such ordinance shall provide that the board of adjustment or, if the council so provides, a special board of appeals created for the purpose by the council shall have the power, upon an appeal filed with it by the owner of such land, to grant a permit for a building or structure or part thereof in any such mapped street location in any case in which such board finds, upon the evidence and arguments presented to it upon such appeal, that:
(1) The entire property of the appellant, of which such mapped street location forms a part, cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such permit is granted; and
(2) Balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the official map and the interest of the owner of the property in the use and benefits of his property, the grant of such permit is required by consideration of reasonable justice and equity.
(f) Before taking any action, the board of adjustment or special board of appeals shall hold a hearing at which the parties interested shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given to the appellant by mail at the address specified by the appellant in his appeal petition. If the board of adjustment grants a building permit in any such appeal, it shall have the power to specify the exact location, extent, ground, area, height, duration and other details and conditions to govern the building, structure or part thereof for which the permit is granted.
(g) After the establishment of the official map, the council may provide by ordinance that no public water or sewer connection or other public utility or improvement shall be constructed in or any water, drainage, light or other public service rendered to or along any street until and unless such street shall have been duly placed on the official map in accordance with the authority and procedure set forth in Subsections (c) and (d) of this section. The council may also provide by general ordinance that no permit for the erection of a building shall be issued unless a street giving access to such proposed structure is shown on the official map; provided, however, that such ordinance shall contain provision whereby the applicant for such a building permit may appeal to the board of adjustment or to the special board of appeals. The hearing upon such appeal and notice of such hearing shall be held and given as provided in Subsection (f) of this section. The board may be granted the authority to issue a permit, subject to such conditions as the board may impose, where the circumstances of the case do not require the proposed building to be related to existing mapped or planned streets and where the permit would not tend to dislocate or increase the difficulty of carrying out the official map or master plan.

(3) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;
(4) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decision-making process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(5) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (a) of this section;

(a) The city shall make the city's public records available for inspection and copying by the public. No person shall remove original public records from the city hall or from the office of the custodian of records without the written permission of the custodian.
(b) To the greatest extent feasible, city records that are in an electronic format are to be made available to the public in the same format. The city may not enter into a contract for the creation or maintenance of a public records database if that contract impairs the ability of the public to inspect or copy the public records of that agency, including public records that are on-line or stored in an electronic recordkeeping system used by the agency. Such contract may not allow any impediment that as a practical matter makes it more difficult for the public to inspect or copy the records than to inspect or copy the city’s records. For purposes of this section, a useable electronic format shall allow, at a minimum, viewing and printing of records. However, if the city keeps a record on a system capable of allowing the copying of electronic documents into other electronic documents, the city shall provide data to the public in such electronic format, if requested. The activities authorized pursuant to this subsection may not take priority over the primary responsibilities of the city. For purposes of this section, the term “electronic services” means on-line access or access via other electronic means to an electronic file or database. This subsection shall not apply to contracts initially entered into before August 28, 2004.
(c) Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received by the custodian of records of the city. If records are requested in a certain format, the city shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is available and if the process of creating such format does not take priority over the primary responsibilities of the city. If access to the public records is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that the records will be available for inspection. This period for document production may exceed three business days for reasonable cause.

The provisions of this section shall apply to messages sent to two or more members of that body so that, when counting the sender, the majority of the body’s members are copied.

Such rate shall be established annually by the director of financial services.
(b) Research time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall use employees of the body that are capable of completing the tasks and result in the lowest amount of charges for the research.
(c) A fee of $5.00 per document shall be charged for document certification
(d) Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items of devices, and for paper copies larger than nine by 14 inches shall include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the actual costs of such programming by internal or external sources.
(e) Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the records may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person requesting the records.
(f) Payment of such fees may be requested in advance.
(g) Documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body or members of the city’s executive staff determine that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial or other private interest of the requestor. Those specifically exempted from paying a fee are other public governmental entities and students showing a valid identification card.

Persons desiring access to information or entries excised from such records may file a supplementary written request with the custodian of records for disclosure of material to be specified in the request, which request should state:
(1) Whether or not the requesting party has informed persons to whom the requested information pertains of the request; and
(2) All reasons why the requesting party believes disclosure by the city of specified information is in the public interest.
(b) The custodian of records may afford all interested parties, including the persons to whom the information pertains, a reasonable time within which to comment on the requested disclosure prior to acting further on the request. If an interested person objects to the disclosure of the requested information, the custodian of records may conduct a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard. At such hearing the custodian shall consider, among such other factors as may be reasonable and relevant:
(1) The requirements and intent of state law, city ordinances and this policy;
(2) The legitimate expectations of privacy on the part of interested parties;
(3) The personal, confidential, private or proprietary nature of the information at issue;
(4) Whether the information was obtained by the city under compulsion of law or was freely and voluntarily provided by the persons objecting to the disclosure; and
(5) The public purposes to be served by disclosure of the requested information.
If the custodian of records determines that disclosure is legally required or would otherwise serve the best interests of the public and that such requirements or purpose outweigh the legitimate concerns or interests of the persons to whom the information pertains, the custodian shall provide the requested information to the requesting party.
(c) In addition to or in lieu of the hearing described above, the custodian of records may afford all interested parties a reasonable opportunity to seek judicial review of or relief from the proposed disclosure. The custodian may also utilize the procedures for judicial determination and/or opinion solicitation provided in Section 2-1317, below.

When designing a public record, the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from nonexempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.

Upon being recorded/filed in the manner required by state law, a lien may be imposed on the real or personal property of any recipient of an administrative building citation in the amount of any debt due the city under this division and enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien under a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 2-1441. Concurrent enforcement prohibited.
Any person or other legal entity that violates any provision of the Code of Ordinance which may be enforced by the issuance of an administrative building citation may be required to pay a penalty or may be issued a summons to appear in municipal court; however, no person or other legal entity may be required to pay a penalty for the same condition constituting a violation on the same day that said person or other legal entity is also issued a summons to appear in municipal court. In no event shall this section be interpreted as limiting the discretion of the city manager or any of his or her designees to issue an administrative citation or a summons to appear in municipal court or to abate the situation constituting a violation as allowed by the code of ordinances.

(a) Development, adoption and amendment; implementation of local emergency management Plan. The emergency management plan shall be adopted to govern local emergency management activities for the municipality; both internally and in cooperation with other governmental units. In addition, the emergency plan shall serve to provide guidance in those instances which, by the very nature of emergencies, cannot be predicted or expected.

(3) The local emergency management coordinator may take such action with regard to expenditure of funds as necessary in light of existing circumstances to protect the health and safety of persons and property; provided that the local emergency management coordinator shall obtain consent of the city manager, or his or her designate, prior to such expenditure.

(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1454. Declaration of local state of emergency; procedures.
(a) General standard as guidance. As emergencies, by their nature, may require that action be taken promptly or in a different manner than that set forth in this or other ordinances, the procedures specified in this section are recommended procedures to be followed when practicable. Based on the nature of the emergency, any reasonable procedure, as determined within the sole discretion of the city manager, shall be deemed adequate and proper for all purposes.
(1) The city manager, the local emergency management coordinator, the fire chief, the police chief, or, in their absence, any responsible local government employee, may request that the mayor of the municipality declare the existence of a local state of emergency. The request need not be in writing, but a written record of the request and supporting reasons shall be made as promptly as is reasonably possible under the circumstances. The mayor of the municipality may also initiate a declaration of a local state of emergency based on his or her own determination of the need therefore.
(2) The mayor of the municipality shall review relevant information and undertake consultation as deemed necessary in connection with a requested declaration. When practicable, the mayor of the municipality shall advise the state prior to declaring a local state of emergency and, if prior notice is not given, shall notify the state of issuance of the declaration as soon as practicable after its issuance.
(3) The mayor of the municipality may request that the local state of emergency be converted into a state or regional state of emergency by notifying the state director.
(4) The local organization shall review the need for continuing the local state of emergency at least every fourteen days until the local State of Emergency is terminated by the city council.

(b) Notification of declaration. Upon issuance of a declaration of a local state of emergency, the mayor of the municipality shall notify all appropriate municipal personnel and shall indicate the nature of extraordinary actions that may be taken during the state of emergency. Based on considerations of public safety, and to avoid interference with preparation and response to the emergency, the city manager shall

determine the extent and manner of release of notice to the public and media.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1455. Local state of emergency; declared and undeclared; powers and duties.
(a) General provisions (no state or regional declaration). In any state of emergency that is within the ability and capacity of the municipality to control, with or without mutual assistance, and when no local state or regional state of emergency has been formally declared, the following provisions apply:
(1) The local emergency management coordinator shall have direct responsibility for the operation of responses to local emergencies in accordance with the emergency management plan.
(2) The local emergency management coordinator may exercise general control over first responders to coordinate responses and avoid duplication, repetition or conflict, and assure that services are provided as expeditiously as possible.
(3) Until a formal declaration of state of emergency is issued under subsection (b) and (c) below, the local emergency management coordinator may not exercise the powers listed under those subsections.
(b) Declared state of local emergency. The power to declare a local state of emergency is vested in the mayor, in accordance with Section 2-1454 above; provided, however, that if the mayor is unavailable or incapacitated, this power shall be transferred to another individual who meets with the approval of the state director. Upon issuance of a declaration of a local state of emergency:
(1) The local organization shall attempt to meet as soon as practicable to confirm the declaration and ratify implementation of emergency powers that may be exercised under this ordinance. Such confirmation and ratification, however, is not required to implement emergency powers on an interim basis. In addition, any determination by the local organization not to confirm or ratify the emergency shall not affect the implementation of emergency powers on an interim basis prior to that time and shall not serve as a basis for any action against the municipality or for imposition of discipline against any employee or official unless the declaration was manifestly improper or contrary to law.
(2) The local emergency management coordinator may:
a. Enter into contracts and incur obligations necessary to address the emergency, protect the health and safety of persons and property and provide emergency assistance to victims.
b. In accordance with Section 2-1456 below, and other provisions of this ordinance, exercise powers under this ordinance in light of the exigencies of the extreme emergency situation without regard to time-consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to:
i. performance of public work;
ii. entering into contracts;
iii. incurring of obligations;

e. Represent the municipality in all dealings with public or private agencies and the media on matters pertaining to the emergency.
(c) Emergency beyond local control. In any state of emergency that is beyond the capacity of the municipality to control, the Municipality’s actions and response shall be governed by RSMo., Chapter 44 and shall include the powers and duties set forth in this ordinance to be exercised in accordance with RSMo., Chapter 44 and any other applicable laws, such as mutual aid statutes.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1456. Emergency; extraordinary powers.
(a) Local emergency management coordinator. After declaration of a local state of emergency or in response to a declaration of emergency on a state or regional basis, the local emergency management coordinator may:
(1) In accordance with applicable provisions of this ordinance, issue rules on matters reasonably related to protection of life and property that may be affected by the emergency, including matters such as, but not limited to, evacuation, opening and closing hours for all or any class of business operations, closing roads to all or particular classes of vehicles, closing schools, closing or regulating access to public places, isolation, quarantine, and curfews. Such rules shall be confirmed at the earliest practicable time by the local organization.
(2) Require emergency services to be performed by any officer or employee of the municipality and acquire the assistance of as many individuals in the municipality as the local emergency management coordinator deems necessary in response to the emergency. Such officials, employees and individuals shall be entitled to all privileges, benefits and immunities as are provided by state law for municipal employees or volunteers under any applicable law.
(3) Requisition necessary personnel or material of any department of the municipality.
(4) Exercise all of the powers conferred upon the local emergency management coordinator by state or federal law, by this ordinance, by the municipality’s emergency plan, or by ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council.
(b) Waiver of “time-consuming procedures and formalities.” With regard to powers vested in the local emergency management coordinator, pursuant to Subsection 2-1455(b)(2)a, the purpose of waiving procedures and formalities is to permit the municipality to respond to the emergency in an effective and timely manner. To do so may require variance from otherwise applicable procedures and requirements such as competitive bidding, notice and hearing and formalities of approval of appropriation of transfers. Emergency response may also require that public or private property be used without formal documentation of its temporary application for such purposes. The waiver of formalities and procedural requirements under such circumstances shall be intended solely to facilitate emergency management and shall, to the extent possible, be used in accordance with the following guidelines:
(1) If it provides guidance, the emergency plan and Subsection 2-1453(b) shall be followed.
(2) Waivers shall be documented as to their nature, the necessity therefore and the procedures that were utilized. That documentation shall be supplied as soon as possible to the city manager, the resource and supply coordinator and the local organization.
(3) The local emergency management coordinator shall keep accurate records of any funds expended pursuant to waivers and submit a report thereof to the city manager who shall promptly determine if after-the-fact transfers can be made within the limits of available appropriations or if additional appropriation action by the city council is required.
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
§2-1434
(2/1/19)
CD2:96.3
(4) If any public or private property has been used during such emergency without formal documentation or authorization, that use shall cease when it is reasonable to do so, and the local emergency management coordinator shall report such use to the city manager who shall determine if compensation, reparation or repairs are requirement in connection with such use, as well as the need for any further appropriation action by the city council.
(c) State or national emergency declaration powers. If a state or national emergency has been declared, the local emergency management coordinator shall be vested with such powers as may be provided under state or federal law or in accordance with the declaration.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1457. Continuity of government.
(a) Unavailability/vacancy: Local emergency management coordinator. If the position of local emergency management coordinator is vacant, or if the local emergency management coordinator is not available, during any state of emergency, the fire chief shall act in the local emergency management coordinator’s place. If the fire chief is unavailable during any state of emergency, the local organization will, as promptly as possible, appoint someone to serve in an acting or interim capacity. If the local organization is unable to make such an appointment, the police chief shall act in the local emergency management coordinator’s place and shall request assistance from the division or other state, regional or local agency.
(b) Local organization/city council. During any emergency, the local organization and/or city council may meet in accordance with this section when a quorum of either body cannot be convened under normal operating rules and procedures due to the Emergency.

Such sites, or places, may be within or without the territorial limits of such municipality, but shall be within the state.
Meetings may be called by the local emergency management coordinator or the city manager. If neither is available, any member of the local organization may call a meeting. Notice of the meeting shall be given in any manner that is reasonably calculated to inform members that a meeting will occur. Meetings shall be open to the public, except as allowed under RSMo., Section 610.021. If a quorum cannot attend, then the quorum required for action during this interim emergency period shall be the number of members present and acting.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1458. Conflicting ordinances and regulations.
Any ordinances, rules, policies or orders promulgated during a declared state of emergency shall take precedence over existing ordinances, rules and regulations if a conflict arises. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency affecting the municipality:
(1) Purchasing and public works contracts. The city council may enter into/authorize the city manager to enter into necessary contracts in response to an emergency without formal competitive bidding procedures and without advertising and posting notice of any such contract. However, any such contract entered into, pursuant to this subsection, shall be noted in the minutes of the next meeting of the city council following execution of the contract.
(2) Enforcement of city code of ordinances. The city council may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the municipality’s code of ordinances or any portion thereof, if:

ST. JOSEPH CODE
§2-1422
(2/1/19)
CD2:96.2

(3) Temporary dwellings. The city council may authorize the issuance of temporary building permits to allow manufactured housing, mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles or other temporary dwelling structures to be used in any zoning district while a primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings meet minimal standards for health and safety, including requirements for adequate water supply and waste disposal. The temporary permit may be issued upon such additional conditions as are deemed reasonable. Any such temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of continuing hardship and in the discretion of the city council, the permit may be extended for up to an additional six months. Upon expiration of the temporary permit or an extension thereof, the temporary dwelling shall be removed and any property disturbed shall be restored.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1459. Mutual aid.
(a) Emergency assistance mutual aid. As permitted by and subject to applicable statutes, the local emergency management coordinator, with approval of the city manager, may enter mutual aid agreements for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance. The local emergency management coordinator shall be responsible for initiating or responding to requests for mutual aid and shall have the authority to determine the nature of the request and response. The local emergency management coordinator shall consult the police chief and fire chief, as well as the public works and transportation director, with respect to needs for mutual aid when requesting the same and with regard to availability of resources to respond to requests for mutual aid.
(b) Mutual aid coordination and cooperation. When mutual aid is provided when a local state of emergency, or statewide or regional state of emergency, has been declared that includes the municipality, the local emergency management coordinator may coordinate the direct operations in furtherance of the purposes of this ordinance. The police chief and fire chief shall ensure that copies of all mutual aid agreements are placed on file with the city clerk. In case of conflict between the emergency plan and any mutual aid agreement, the emergency plan shall govern for all situations in which the municipality is the primary responder and when a declaration of a local state of emergency is in effect.

In carrying out the responsibilities of emergency preparation, management and response under this ordinance, local officials, officers and employees, including law enforcement officials, shall be deemed to be exercising community caretaking powers and duties, except when the primary purpose of the activity is related to apprehension or investigation in criminal matters. When reasonably exercising “community caretaking functions,” as defined in Subsection (b) below, law enforcement officers need not strictly comply with requirements normally imposed in connection with certain law enforcement functions.
(1) Law enforcement during emergencies. A law enforcement officer, in carrying out law enforcement responsibilities during a declared state of emergency, may engage in inquiries, brief detentions, reasonable searches and arrests in accordance with accepted exceptions to warrant procedural requirements.
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
§2-1434
(2/1/19)
CD2:96.3
(2) Community caretaking functions. A law enforcement officer is deemed to be acting in a community caretaking function when the officer acts to (1) render aid, (2) assess and respond to a situation posing an imminent serous threat to life or property, or (3) otherwise protect the public health and safety from imminent harm. Community caretaking functions are deemed to exist when a declared State of emergency exists, or when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists, that presents an imminent or serious threat to life or property; prompt action is required and taken; the officer’s action is not motivated or related to investigation or evidence acquisition for criminal matters; and the officer acts reasonably under the circumstances. Community caretaking functions that can be performed under this section include, without limitation by reason of enumeration, detention of people, seizure of property and entry into premises without warrants to:
a. Render emergency medical treatment;
b. Search for a victim or missing or
kidnapped person;

(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1462. Emergency management: build-ing and development planning.
A major goal of emergency management is the prevention of bodily injury and property damage. Accordingly, all buildings, site development and related actions by the municipality shall be reviewed with the local organization as part of the planning process for their effect on and potential role in emergency management. In addition, the planning commission shall consider emergency management in formulating and applying land use planning ordinances and regulations. To the extent feasible, the local organization, local emergency management coordinator and city manager shall consult with the public concerning emergency planning with regard to development proposals and shall seek to provide input and information about local emergency management concerns with respect to developments by other governmental units.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1463. Evacuations; property searches/seizures; curfews.
(a) Evacuations. The city manager, after review by the local emergency management coordinator, the police chief or fire chief, and with the consent of the local organization, may order the evacuation of specified areas of the municipality. The evacuation order may be advisory or mandatory based on the situation. The local emergency management coordinator shall provide as much public notice of any evacuation order as is deemed possible and appropriate under the circumstances.
(1) All persons subject to any mandatory order shall promptly comply. All law enforcement officials are empowered to enforce the terms of any mandatory evacuation order. Any person who refuses to comply with an evacuation order or advisory shall be deemed responsible for any consequent injury to persons or property and shall indemnify and hold harmless the municipality for any damages incurred as a result of noncompliance.
(2) The local emergency management coordinator and other officials or employees of the municipality may assist
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§2-1422
(2/1/19)
CD2:96.2
in implementing any evacuation order issued pursuant to state or federal authority.
(b) Property searches/seizures. As needed in an emergency, local emergency management personnel may need access and entry to property owned by persons other than the municipality. When feasible, attempts shall be made to obtain owner or occupant consent for entry. However, when required, in the sole judgment of the local emergency management coordinator or other person in control of the situation, when consent cannot reasonably be obtained, entry may be gained by reasonable means appropriate to the situation. Entry may be used, for example, to find individuals, pets or other living beings or to locate property when they are in danger of harm or injury as a result of conditions causing or resulting from the emergency. Law enforcement personnel involved in such an entry shall be deemed to be engaged in “community caretaking functions” in accordance with Subsection 2-1461(b).
(c) Curfews. Upon declaration of a state, regional or local state of emergency that includes the municipality and if a curfew is not otherwise in effect, the city council may, by resolution, institute a curfew when determined necessary to protect and safeguard persons and property. The resolution instituting the curfew shall state the geographic extent and dates and hours that the curfew shall be in effect.
(1) A curfew under this section shall require all persons who are not exempt by Subsection 2-1463(c)(2) below or other law to remove themselves from any public way, street or place during the curfew. The order may also specify that certain businesses whose operation could impose a danger to persons or property be closed or restricted during the curfew.
(2) Unless otherwise specified, the following individuals shall be exempt from its requirements: individuals engaged in providing designated, essential services, such as fire, law enforcement, emergency medical and hospital, military and utility emergency repairs. The resolution may also exempt regular employees of local industries traveling to and from their jobs with appropriate identification, news media employees, building and repair contractors and their employees performing activities related to construction, repair, renovation or improvement of buildings and other structures damaged during the emergency.
(G.O. 2208, 12-4-06)
Sec. 2-1464. Volunteers, donations.
(a) Volunteers. The municipality encourages volunteerism. However, emergencies may pose special risks so that untrained, unsupervised or unauthorized volunteers may increase risks rather than assist in preventing or mitigating damage. The emergency plan shall identify appropriate training for volunteers in emergency situations and the city council shall arrange for training within the limits of funds appropriated for that purpose.

If the violation of this article is on private property, proof that a person owns the property, occupies the property or otherwise has possession or the right to possession of the property constitutes prima facie evidence for the purpose of this article that such person has caused, maintained or permitted the condition constituting the violation and such person will be responsible for abatement or repair of such condition.
(2) Separate offenses. A person or other legal entity must not fail, neglect or refuse to comply with a valid notice of violation issued pursuant to this article within the time specified in such notice.

If a notice of violation has validly been posted at the property, pursuant to this article, failure to give notice as set forth in this article shall neither invalidate a lien against the land for the costs associated with abatement or repair of a condition causing the property to be in violation of this article nor invalidate an administrative citation issued pursuant to this article.

a. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person or other legal entity to commit an unlawful act under this article.

(3) Security fencing. In addition to other applicable requirements, the tower and any appurtenances shall be safely maintained and fenced or otherwise secured to prevent unauthorized access or climbing of the tower. Barbed, electrified or razor wire is prohibited. Tower legs shall be of monopole design without use of lattice or guy wire support and be engineered and designed with sufficient depth, counter-weight and other mechanisms to address wind-loading and other failure risks under all reasonably anticipated conditions and circumstances.

If a tower is abandoned, it shall be removed at the owner’s expense. Failure to comply with this provision shall constitute a public nuisance and building code violation that may be remedied by the city at the tower or property owner’s expense. Any applicant for a new tower shall place a bond or other security with the city prior to any final approval to ensure abandoned Towers can be removed. The bond or security shall be in the form and amount approved by the chief building official . The amount of the bond shall be determined by the chief building official to satisfy the requirements hereof with regard to the specific tower to which it would apply based on the estimated total cost of removal of that tower.
(b) Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the chief building official under this section shall have the right to appeal such decision under Article XIII of Chapter 2. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the review procedures under Article XIII of Chapter 2 shall be exhausted before any action may be filed in any court against the city or its officers, employees, boards, officials or commissions.

CD8:5
(c) It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors; to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult; and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible.

(e) The license and permit fees required in Division 2 of this article are nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry.

(g) Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary to deter prostitution or high-risk sexual conduct that may be associated with adult entertainment facilities and to limit the health hazards of syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS that may result.

The franchise fee paid to the city by the franchisee pursuant to this section shall include any tax, fee or assessment of any kind imposed by the city on the franchisee solely because of its status as a cable operator. This franchise fee shall be paid by the franchisee in addition to: (i) any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability, (including any such tax, fee or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable operators or their services, but not including a tax, fee, or assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or cable subscribers), including, but not limited to, personal property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes or real estate taxes; (ii) any capital costs required by the franchise to be incurred by the franchisee for the government channel or any educational channel facilities; or (iii) any requirements or charges incidental to the awarding or enforcing of the franchise, including payments for bonds, security funds, letters of credit, insurance, indemnification, penalties or liquidated damages.

not be construed as an acknowledgement that the amount paid is a correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums due and payable. All franchise fee payments shall be subject to audit by the city for a period of five years after receipt thereof and further shall be subject to assessment or refund if the payment is found to be in error. In the event that said audit results in an assessment of an additional payment to the city, said additional payment shall be subject to interest from the date on which such payment was due and payable.

Any additional amount due the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the franchisee by the city, which shall include a copy of the audit report. Any additional amounts due the city at any time during the term of this franchise shall be collectible by the city in any action, upon refusal of payment by the franchisee, brought within ten (10) years after the expiration of this franchise.

In conjunction with each non-standard extension proposed under this section, the franchisee shall document the actual cost of the extension and shall provide for non-personal disclosure of such documentation at its office in the city.
(c) Non-standard extension procedure. When the estimated cost of construction of a non-standard extension is determined, each potential subscriber desiring cable service shall provide the franchisee with a deposit equal to the estimated cost of construction divided by the total number of potential subscribers desiring service. The deposit shall be amended or refunded accordingly when the actual cost of construction is determined. The franchisee shall proceed with construction promptly, barring events beyond its control.
(d) Non-standard extension cost recovery. The franchisee shall refund to current or past subscribers in an area served by a non-standard extension, as herein defined, all non-standard extension costs paid by such subscribers when the minimum density requirements of subsection (a) have been met in the area. Such refunds are not otherwise limited, but may be made at the franchisee's discretion to only those subscribers who paid shares of non-standard extension costs and who still own or occupy the affected residential dwelling units or other structure in the area, and when the minimum density requirements in the area are met within five (5) years.

(d) Special testing. At any time after commencement of cable service to subscribers and at the city's discretion, the city may require the franchisee to perform additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, different test procedures, or tests involving a specific subscriber's drop in order to demonstrate compliance by the franchisee with technical standards applicable to the system. Such additional tests, which may include, but are not limited to, video carrier levels on each activated channel, low frequency distortion assessment, intermodulation distortion assessment, Rf signal leakage evaluation, and signal quality measurement at system headend of satellite services, locally originated broadcasting, and area broadcast stations, shall be required only on the basis of complaints received from subscribers or other evidence indicating an unresolved controversy or significant noncompliance with applicable technical standards and such tests will be limited to the particular matter in controversy.

Sec. 9-18. Letter of credit.

At the time this franchise is accepted, the franchisee shall deliver to the city an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit, in form and substance acceptable to city, from a national or state bank approved by the city in the sum of $10,000.00 as security for the faithful performance by it of all the provisions of the franchise and compliance with all applicable orders, permits and directions of the city and the payment of the franchisee of any claim, liens and taxes due to the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.

ST. JOSEPH CODE
§9-39
(2/1/08)
CD9:24
applicable liability of the franchisee to the city, but only to the extent of said draw.
(c) Renewal of the letter. If said letter of credit or any subsequent letter of credit delivered pursuant hereto expires prior to 15 months after the expiration of the term of the franchise, it shall be renewed or replaced during the term of the franchise to provide that it will not expire earlier than 15 months after the expiration of the franchise. The renewed or replaced letter of credit shall be on the same form and with a bank authorized herein and for the full amount stated in paragraph (a) of this section. If the franchisee cannot obtain a letter of credit extending past the expiration of the franchise, the franchisee shall post a cash bond or cash security fund, or other financial instrument acceptable to the city and the franchisee, to expire no later than 15 months after the expiration of the franchise.
(d) Replenishment of the letter. Throughout the term of this franchise, the franchisee shall maintain the letter of credit in the amount specified in subsection (a) hereof. Within 30 days after receipt of notice from the city that any amount has been drawn from the letter of credit, the franchisee shall restore the letter of credit to the amount specified in subsection (a) hereof, provided that such restoration obligation shall be suspended during the period of any arbitration proceedings brought by the franchisee, pursuant to Section 9-39 of this franchise, to determine the propriety of such withdrawal from the letter of credit. If the arbitrators determine that such with-drawal by the city was improper, the city shall restore the improperly withdrawn amount of the letter of credit, together with interest that would have accrued thereon, but for the withdrawal.
(e) Failure to replenish. If any letter of credit is not replenished, and the franchisee has not challenged the propriety of withdrawal as provided in Subsection (d) hereof, the city may draw on said letter of credit for the whole amount thereof and hold the proceeds, without interest to franchisee, and use the proceeds to pay costs incurred by the city in performing and paying for any or all of the obligations, duties and responsibilities of the franchisee under the franchise that are not performed or paid for by the franchisee pursuant hereto, including attorneys' fees incurred by the city in so performing and paying. The failure to so replenish any letter of credit may also, at the option of the city, be deemed a default by the franchisee under this franchise. The drawing on the letter of credit by the city, and use of the money so obtained for payment of liquidated damages or of expenses incurred by the city in connection with performing or securing performance of the franchise provisions by the franchisee, shall not be a waiver or release of any default by the franchisee.
(f) Withdrawals. If the franchisee fails, after 30 days' notice and right to cure, to reimburse or pay the city for any damages, losses, costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with performing or securing performance of the franchise provisions by the franchisee or fails to make any payment to the city required by this franchise within the time fixed herein, the city may immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any liquidated damages, from the letter of credit. Within ten (10) days after any such withdrawal, the city shall notify the franchisee in writing of the amount and date thereof.
(g) Liquidated damages from the letter.

(7) for failure to comply with any of the provisions of any section of the franchise for which an amount is not otherwise specifically provided pursuant to this section and failure to correct such condition within 30 days of the receipt of written notice from the city, the amount shall be $100.00 per day.
Each violation of any provision of the franchise shall be considered a separate violation for which a separate remedy can be imposed.
Within ten (10) days after each of the foregoing withdrawals, the city shall notify the franchisee in writing of the amount and date thereof.
(h) City may recover only actual damages. Nothing contained herein authorizing the city to exercise one or more of its rights or remedies shall be construed to permit the city to recover more then the amount of its actual damages resulting from any act or omission of the franchisee.
(i) Arbitration of imposed liquidated damages. In the event the franchisee disagrees with or wishes to contest the city's decision to liquidate damages according to the provisions and procedures of this franchise, the franchisee or the city may request arbitration of such disagreement according to the provisions of Section 9-39. Multiple requests for arbitration of multiple impositions of liquidated damages stemming from a single incident, situation, or set of circumstances, or from closely related incidents, situations, or sets of circumstances, shall be handled as one case for purposes of arbitration.

At the mutual agreement of the city and the franchisee, this franchise may be amended to include any additional terms or conditions which are included in any other communication, franchise agreement or contract to which the franchisee and another franchising authority are parties and which, in the city's determination, are more favorable or less burdensome to the city than conditions or terms presently included or absent from this franchise.

The franchisee shall provide, in addition, an emergency warning system whereby the city's emergency communications unit can be used to make voice announcements simultaneously over all cable service channels on the system. Such emergency warning system shall be a twenty-four-hour "hot standby" system which will preempt the sound on all cable service channels. If at any time, in the case of fire or disaster in the city, it shall become necessary in the reasonable determination of the city to cut or remove any wires, cables, amplifiers, or other appurtenances to the system, such cutting or removing may be done and any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the franchisee at its sole expense, provided that such repairs are not necessitated by willful misconduct of the City.
(1969 Code, Sec. 7 1/2-34; G.O. 1149, 1-31-94)
Sec. 9-35. Severability.
(a) Severable conditions. In the event that any court, agency, commission, legislative body, or other authority of competent jurisdiction:
(1) declares this franchise invalid, in whole or in part, or
(2) requires the franchisee either to
a. perform any act which is inconsistent with any provision of this franchise, or
b. cease performing any act required by any provision of this franchise.
Then the franchisee or the city shall notify the other of such fact promptly upon becoming aware of such fact. If the city determines that such declaration or requirement does not have a material and adverse effect upon it, then the franchisee shall comply with such declaration or requirement within no later than 60 days and this franchise shall be deemed to be modified in order to conform to such declaration or requirement and such modification shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision hereof. In the event that such declaration or requirement is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended, or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the declaration or requirement, then such provision thereupon shall return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the city and the franchisee, provided that the city shall give the franchisee thirty (30) days' written notice of such change before requiring compliance with such provisions. In the event that such declaration or requirement has a material and adverse effect on the city under this franchise, then the city and the franchisee shall enter into good faith negotiations to amend this agreement so as to enable the franchisee to perform obligations for the benefit of the city as substantially equivalent to those obligations imposed by this franchise immediately prior to such declaration or requirement, to the maximum extent consistent with such declaration or requirement. In connection with such negotiations, the city and the franchisee shall consider whether the circumstances existing at that time are such that the franchisee should continue to perform such obligations or their substantial equivalent. Nothing herein shall be construed to grant either the city or the franchisee the right to amend or modify this franchise without the agreement of the other.

Sec. 11-27. Determination of necessity.
It is determined and declared by the council that:
(1) In certain portions of the city obsolete, decadent, substandard, insanitary or blighted areas exist occasioned by inadequate planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air or open space, defective design or arrangement of buildings, lack of proper sanitary facilities or the existence of buildings which, by reason of age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design or physical deterioration, have impaired the economic value of certain areas, infecting them with blight, and that such areas are characterized by depreciated values, impaired investments, reduced or negligible income and consequent tax delinquencies;
(2) Such conditions exist in areas where obsolete, decadent, substandard, insanitary, outworn or outmoded industrial, commercial or residential buildings prevail, and such are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime;
(3) Such conditions occur chiefly in areas which are subdivided into small parcels with multiple ownership and frequently with confusion as to title;
(4) Their assembly for purposes of clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction and redevelopment is difficult and costly;
(5) The existence of such condition and the failure to clear, replan, rehabilitate, reconstruct or redevelop these areas results in progressive deterioration, in a loss of population by the areas, causes a wasteful expenditure of public funds for policing and occasions large outlays for the creation of public facilities and services elsewhere;
(6) It is impossible and uneconomic for individual owners to independently undertake to remedy such conditions;
(7) Such conditions require the employment of capital on an investment basis, allowing, however, the widest latitude in the amortization of any indebtedness created thereby;
(8) Such conditions further require the acquisition of adequate areas, at fair prices, the clearance of such areas through demolition of existing obsolete, decadent, inadequate, unsafe or insanitary buildings and the redevelop-ment of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate planning as to land use and construction policies;
(9) The clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction and redevelopment of such areas on a large scale basis are necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and purposes for which private property may be acquired by purchase or eminent domain; and
(10) Such obsolete, decadent, substandard, insanitary and blighted areas constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the city.

(a) Acquisition of property. An urban redevelopment corporation may acquire real property or secure options in its own name or in the name of nominees, and it may acquire real property by gift, grant, lease, purchase or otherwise.
(b) Encumbrance of property. An urban redevelopment corporation may borrow funds and secure the repayment thereof by mortgage, which shall contain reasonable amortization provisions and shall be a lien upon no other real property except that forming the whole or a part of a single development area. Any mortgage on the real property in a development area or any part thereof may create a first lien or a second or junior lien upon such real property.
(c) Disposal of property. An urban redevelopment corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of the real property acquired by it for the purpose of a redevelopment project. The ordinance approving any development plan and any contract entered into pursuant thereto may provide that if the sale or other disposition of real property of any urban redevelopment corporation shall occur because of the foreclosure of any mortgage or other lien through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings or by order of any court of competent jurisdiction or by voluntary transfer or otherwise, the partial tax relief provided under Section 11-35 shall inure to any purchaser of such real property so long as such purchaser shall continue to use, operate and maintain such real property in accordance with the provisions of the development plan.

§11-64
(4/1/05)
CD11:8
corporation, as was determined by the assessor of the county, for taxes due and payable thereon during the calendar year preceding the calendar year during which the corporation acquired title to such real property, and the amounts of such tax assessments shall not be increased during such ten-year period so long as the real property is owned by a corporation and used in accordance with a development plan authorized by the council.
(2) Property already exempt. If, however, any such real property was tax exempt immediately prior to ownership by any such corporation, the city council shall immediately request the county assessor to promptly assess such land, exclusive of improvements, in accordance with the provisions of RSMo 353.110. The amount of such assessed valuation so fixed by the county assessor shall not be increased during the ten-year period next following the date upon which such corporation acquired ownership thereof, so long as such property is owned by such corporation and used in accordance with the development plan authorized and approved by the council.
(3) Partial exemption. For the next ensuing period not in excess of 15 years, city ad valorem taxes upon such real property shall be measured by the assessed valuation thereof as determined by the city council upon the basis of not to exceed 50% of the true value of such real property, including any improvements thereon, nor shall such valuations be increased over 50% of the true value of such real property from year to year during the period of 15 years, so long as such real property is owned by a corporation and used in accordance with an authorized development plan.
(4) Full assessment. After such periods, totaling not more than 25 years, such real property shall be subject to assessment by the city and payment of all ad valorem taxes based on the full true value of the real property and shall be owned and operated by the urban redevelopment corporation free from the conditions, restrictions and provisions of this article, the approving ordinance and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article, provided that at any time after the completion of the redevelopment project as authorized by ordinance, the urban redevelopment corporation may elect to pay the city a sum equivalent to the amount of the general ad valorem taxes, not including interest or penalties, which would have been levied on the full value of the property from the date of the completion of the project. From that date such real property shall be owned and operated by the urban redevelopment corporation free from the conditions, restrictions and provisions of this article, the approving ordinance and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article.

Sec. 15-4. Procedure to abate.
Whenever the director of planning & community development finds that a nuisance exists as defined in this chapter, the procedure for abatement shall be as follows:
(1) Notice. The director of planning & community development shall provide written notice to the owner of the property and, if the property is not owner-occupied, any occupant of the property that he/she must abate or remove a nuisance. The written notice shall specifically describe each condition of the lot or land declared to be a public nuisance, and identify what action will remedy the public nuisance. Unless a condition presents an immediate, specifically identified risk to the public health or safety, the notice shall provide a reasonable time, not less than ten days, in which to abate or commence removal of each condition identified in the notice. Written notice may be given by personal service or by first-class mail to both the occupant of the property at the property address and the owner at the last known address of the owner, if not the same. Such notice shall be required in order to abate the nuisance pursuant to the provisions of this section, but shall not be a prerequisite for a violation of this chapter.
In instances where a nuisance consists of weeds and rank growth of vegetation that are allowed to grow on the same property in violation of this chapter more than once during the same or successive growing seasons, the director of planning & community development may provide notice addressed to the owner and/or the person occupying or having possession or the right to possession of the property by mail that the violation exists and that further violations regarding weeds and rank growths of vegetation during that growing season will be abated without notification. Following such notice, and continuing for one year thereafter, abatement may occur without further notification and collection of costs for such abatement may occur in the same manner as if notification was sent for each abatement.
(2) Prima facie evidence of nuisance. If the nuisance is on private property, proof that a person occupies the property or that a person has possession or the right to possession of the property shall constitute prima facie evidence for purposes of this chapter that such person has caused, maintained or permitted the nuisance; and such person shall be responsible for its abatement. The director of planning & community development may enter upon private property for inspection or abatement purposes in accordance with this section. If any person refuses to allow entry onto his/her private property, a warrant may be obtained for such inspection and purposes from the proper official.
(3) Alternatives. Any person notified, pursuant to this section, that he or she has caused, maintained or permitted a nuisance and that he or she must abate or remove such nuisance shall exercise one of the following alternatives within seven days from the time notice was received:
a. Abate the nuisance at the expense of the person so notified;
b. Furnish the director of planning & community development with written consent for the city to abate the nuisance with the costs of such abatement to be assessed to the person consenting; or
c. Request a reconsideration hearing before the city manager, or his or her designee, to protest the allegation that a nuisance exists by filing a written request with the director of planning & community development.
(4) Appeal. When the city manager, or his or her designee, conducts a reconsideration hearing pursuant to this section and finds that a nuisance exists, an appeal may be taken from that decision by filing for the appropriate relief in the Circuit Court of Buchanan County, Missouri.
(5) Confirmation of nuisance. If the person notified fails to exercise one of the
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§15-36
(5/1/19)
CD15:12
alternatives provided above, or has not secured a reversal of the finding of a nuisance and exhausted his/her appeals, then the director of planning & community development shall confirm the finding that a nuisance exists and proceed with the abatement of the nuisance in any reasonable manner and assess the costs of the abatement and the administrative processing of the nuisance against the property.
(6) Storage, redemption, sale. After the determination that a nuisance exists and abatement is performed in accordance with the requirements of this section, items removed during the nuisance abatement having any apparent monetary value, beyond salvage value, shall be transported to a storage area or lot at the expense of the owner or person from whose property they were removed. It shall then be stored for a period of at least 30 days, and the person entitled to possession thereof may redeem the property by payment to the city of the actual cost of its removal and a reasonable storage and administrative processing fee. If any item is unredeemed after the expiration of the 30-day period, the director of planning & community development may sell it to the highest bidder or, if it has no sale value, may otherwise dispose of it. Any money received from the disposal of any item shall be applied to the costs charged to the owner or person in charge thereof.
(7) Notice of sale. Prior to the sale of any such property obtained in a nuisance abatement pursuant to this section, the director of planning & community development, shall cause to be posted in city hall, at the place of storage and in at least one other public place in the city, a notice of sale stating:
a. that the city is selling abandoned property;
b. the color, make, year, motor number and serial number, if available, and any other information necessary for an accurate identification of the property;
c. the terms of the sale; and
d. the date, time and place of the sale.
This notice shall be published at least once and at least seven days prior to the sale in a newspaper published in the city.
(8) Assessment of abatement costs.
a. If the abatement is performed by city employees, the cost of the abatement will be calculated according to the schedule of costs promulgated by the director of administrative services and kept on file in the office of the city clerk. This schedule is to be determined after an analysis by the director of administrative services to determine an accurate estimation of the costs incurred by the city to abate nuisances subject to this section.
b. If the abatement is performed by contractors hired by the city, the costs charged for the abatement will be the actual amount paid to the contractor for the abatement performed.
c. Any and all direct fees and costs, including, but not limited to, landfill fees shall be included in the abatement cost.
d. All abatements will be subject to an administrative fee as defined in this chapter.

Sec. 15-5. Reconsideration hearing before the city manager.
Whenever any person requests a reconsideration hearing to which he or she is entitled pursuant to this chapter to protest the allegation that a nuisance exists, the city manager, or his or her designee, shall give notice to all interested parties, including the owner and occupant of the property, of the date, time and place of a public hearing to be held to determine whether a nuisance does exist. All persons notified shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and make arguments to the city manager, or his or her designee, and be represented by an attorney. If the city manager, or

§15-36
(5/1/19)
CD15:11
his or her designee, determines that a nuisance does exist, the city manager shall issue to the director of planning & community development an order to abate the nuisance in any reasonable manner and assess the costs as permitted or directed by this chapter. The order shall contain written findings of fact and a copy of the order shall be given to all interested parties. However, the director of planning & community development shall have the power to summarily abate, in any reasonable manner, any nuisance, which constitutes an immediate danger to the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city.

Sec. 15-6. Collection of abatement costs.
(a) When the city expends any funds in the abatement of any nuisance, the costs may be included in the annual real estate tax bill in accordance with the following process:

The tax bill shall be deemed a personal debt against the owner from the date of issuance, and shall also be a lien on the property from the date the tax bill becomes delinquent until paid.
(b) The city may discharge all or any portion of the unrecovered costs or fines added pursuant to this section to the tax bill upon a determination by the city that a public benefit shall be gained by such discharge, and such discharge shall include any costs of tax collection, accrued interest, or attorney fees related to the tax bill.

(3) If the costs and fines are not paid by December 31 of the year in which the costs and fines are included in the real estate tax bill, the tax bill shall be considered delinquent, and the collection of delinquent tax bill shall be governed by the laws governing delinquent and back taxes. The real estate tax bill shall be deemed a personal debt against the owner from the date of issuance and shall also be a lien on the property from the date the tax bill becomes delinquent until paid.
(4) Notice setting forth the costs shall be sent to the property owner and shall contain proof of the initial notice sent to the property owner.
(5) The city may discharge all or any portion of the costs or fines added pursuant to this section to the real estate tax bill upon a determination by the city that a public benefit shall be gained by such discharge, and such discharge shall include any costs of tax collection, accrued interest, or attorneys’ fees related to the real estate tax bill.

(a) Authority. Should any property owner, agent, or occupant, after written notice issued pursuant to this section fail to remove objects, substances or obstructions, as required by this article, which threatens to injure the traveling public, the city may cause to remove the objects, substances, or obstructions, entering upon private property, if necessary, and recover the costs of such removals, together with costs and expenses therefor from the owner of such property, agent of the owner, or occupant of the property by special tax bill or any other means for which the city may collect a debt owed. When such removals are not made by the owner liable therefor, the cost thereof shall be paid out of the general revenue of the city. The cost of administratively processing the abatement to the director of administrative services shall be $75.00 per abatement action, which may be collected in any manner in which costs and expenses of removal may be collected.
(b) Notice. The director of public works and transportation, or his or her designee, shall notify, in writing, the owner of the property and, if the property is not owner-occupied, any occupant of the property that he/she must abate or remove such objects, substances, or obstructions. The written notice required by this paragraph shall be provided no less than ten days before the city causes removals to be made or done unless the condition causes, or is reasonably likely to cause, imminent risk of danger or harm to the health, safety and/or welfare of the public; when the condition causes, or is reasonably likely to cause, imminent risk of danger or harm to the public, notice shall be provided to the extent practicable based on the nature of the condition.

Both the owner and occupant, if any, shall be and remain jointly and severally liable for any such costs, including all applicable administrative processing fees.
(c) Collection of abatement costs and associated fines. When the city expends any funds upon the completion of any such abatement, such costs may be included in the annual real estate tax bill in accordance with the following process:

(3) If the costs and fines are not paid by December 31 of the year in which the costs and fines are included in the real estate tax bill, the real estate tax bill shall be considered delinquent, and the collection of delinquent tax bill shall be governed by the laws governing delinquent and back taxes. The real estate tax bill shall be deemed a personal debt against the owner from the date of issuance, and shall also be a lien on the property from the date the real estate tax bill becomes delinquent until paid.
(4) Notice setting forth the costs shall be sent to the property owner and shall contain proof of the initial notice sent to the property owner.
(5) The city may discharge all or any portion of the costs or fines added pursuant to this section to the real estate tax bill upon a determination by the city that a public benefit shall be gained by such discharge, and such discharge shall include any costs of tax collection, accrued interest, or attorneys’ fees related to the tax bill.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 26-1. Title.
This ordinance shall be known, cited and referred to as the subdivision regulations of St. Joseph, Missouri.
(G.O. 1264, 2-13-95; G.O. 1438, 7-29-96)
Sec. 26-2. Purposes of regulations.
(a) The purposes of these provisions are to regulate the subdivision and improvement of land for urban use, to provide adequate light, air, open space, drainage, transportation, public utilities and other needs; to assure the maintenance of health, safety and an attractive and efficient community; and to encourage the economical use of human and natural resources.
(b) The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban development. The arrangement of land parcels in the community for residential, commercial and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools, parks and other public purposes provides the basic framework for the uses of land and for the arrangement of the community.
(c) These regulations are designed, intended and should be administered in a manner to:
(1) Implement the city's adopted compre-hensive plan of urban development.
(2) Provide for neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of slums and blight.
(3) Harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land in the city to the existing community development and facilitate and coordinate the future development of adjoining tracts.
(4) Provide the best possible design for the tract being subdivided and developed.
(5) Reconcile the diverse interests of the subdivider, adjacent property owners and the city.
(6) Coordinate the provision of streets within subdivisions with existing and planned streets and with other features of the comprehensive plan and official map.
(7) Ensure that all necessary public utilities and facilities are provided and are or will be available, accessible and adequate, pursuant to adopted city standards and requirements, at the time of subdivision or development.
(8) Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision.
(Code 1969, Sec. 20-1; G.O. 1264, 2-13-95; G.O. 1438, 7-29-96)
Sec. 26-3. Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority of RSMo Sections 89.010 through 89.490 and Chapter 445, together with all other statutory and legal authority which now, or which may in the future, provide authority for subdivision regulations.
(G.O. 1264, 2-13-95; G.O. 1438, 7-29-96)
Sec. 26-4. Applicability.
(a) Hereafter, every owner or subdivider of any lot, tract or parcel of land situated within the corporate limits of the city who may seek to subdivide the same into two or more parts for the purpose of laying out any subdivision or any additions thereto shall comply with the provisions of these regulations, unless otherwise exempted pursuant to this section.
(b) The following activities do not require subdivision approval by the city; however, the city shall not extend utilities, provide access to public roads nor issue building permits for the development of any property which has not received final plat approval, except as otherwise provided by these regulations.
(1) The public acquisition of land for the widening of existing streets.
(2) Any lot, parcel or tract of land located within the area governed by these regulations which has been legally subdivided, resubdivided or replatted prior to the adoption of these regulations.
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§26-205
(2/1/19)

(3) A division of property through inheritance, the probate of an estate or by order of a court of law.
(4) The creation of leasehold space within a multi-occupant building, such as a condominium, or a commercial building site which does not abut a public street, or the division of property into such leaseholds, provided that the property is a part of an approved subdivision or addition and regulated in accordance with the site plan requirements of the city, and the plat has been amended as may be required to add easements or otherwise serve the leasehold. For purposes of this action, a leasehold abuts a public street if it is immediately adjacent to a public street or if it is so close to a public street that no usable property lies between the leasehold and the public street.
(Code 1969, Sec. 20-3; G.O. 1264, 2-13-95; G.O. 1438, 7-29-96)
Sec. 26-5. Conformity with zoning ordinance.
All plats reviewed under the provisions of these regulations shall conform to all zoning ordinance provisions for the district in which the plat is to be located. All required zoning changes shall be made prior to approval of the final plat by the council.
(G.O. 1264, 2-13-95; G.O. 1438, 7-29-96)
Sec. 26-6. Interpretation, conflict and separability.
(a) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. These regulations shall be construed broadly to promote the purposes for which they are adopted.
(b) Conflict with other laws. These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law except as pro-vided in these regulations. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations, or other provision of law, the provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards shall control.
(c) Separability. If any part or provision of these regulations or the application of these regu-lations to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any court of competent juris-diction, the judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision or application directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment has been rendered and it shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application of them to other persons or circumstances. The council hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations without any such part, provi-sion or application which is judged to be invalid.
(G.O. 1264, 2-13-95; G.O. 1438, 7-29-96)

The following words or phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
(1) Alley. A minor way which is used primarily for secondary or service access to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
(2) Applicant. A developer or owner submitting an application for subdivision (preliminary or final plat) approval, site plan approval or other development approval.
(3) Application. The application form and all accompanying documents required by these regulations for approval of a subdivision plat.
(4) Arterial. Principal - An interstate roadway or highway that connects the region with other areas of the state and other states, the principal purpose of which is mobility rather than serving individual land uses. Minor - A roadway that connects the urban area to cities and towns inside and outside the region, the principal purpose of which is mobility rather than serving individual land uses; however, access to land is provided at an increasing rate as the minor arterial moves down in the hierarchy. There are three types of minor arterials and the following hierarchy: relievers, which provide direct relief for traffic on major metropolitan highways; expanders, which provide a way to make connections between developing areas outside the interstate ring or beltway; and connectors, which augment principal arterials within the interstate ring or belt-way and also provide good, safe access connections within and among towns in developing and rural areas.

(11) The plat will be laid out and developed in a manner that is sensitive to environmental features and/or characteristics of the tract or parcel including, but not limited to, topography, slope, soils, geology, hydrology, floodplains, wetlands, vegetation and trees. If a proposed plat will require extensive grading, soil removal, fill, cuts and/or removal of mature trees, the commission shall expressly find that such actions represent the minimum necessary for safe and efficient use of the tract or parcel and that no other lot layout would be more effective at preserving environ-mental features and/or characteristics. Where extensive grading, soil removal, fill, cuts and/or removal of mature trees is proposed by the applicant, the commission shall urge the applicant to consider cluster or planned development to obtain the same number of lots but without environmental damage.
(12) The plat is located in an area of the city that is appropriate for current development activity and which will not contribute to sprawl and leapfrog development patterns nor to the need for inefficient extensions and expansions of public facilities, utilities and services.
(13) If located in an area proposed for annexation to the city, the area has been annexed prior to, or will be annexed simultaneously with, plat approval.
(14) The applicant agrees to dedicate land, right-of-way and easements, as may be determined to be needed to effectuate the purposes of these regulations and the standards and requirements incorporated herein.
(15) All relevant and applicable submission requirements have been satisfied in a timely manner.
(16) Improvements may include any necessary upgrades to the adjacent existing roads and facilities to current standards and shall include dedication of adequate right-of-way to meet the needs of the city’s transportation plan.
(h) Recommendation of disapproval. If the commission recommends disapproval of the preliminary plat, the grounds for such recom-mendation shall be made a matter of record.
(i) City council. Following action by the commission, the council shall review the application and the recommendation of the commission and either approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. The council shall base its review and decision on the criteria listed in Section 26-45(g) herein and such other factors as it deems relevant and applicable.
(1) If the preliminary plat is approved without conditions and meets the requirements of a final plat, the plat shall be considered to be an approved final plat and shall be subject only to the council's acceptance of all required dedications, and may be filed and recorded pursuant to Sections 26-46(h) and (i).

(2) If the preliminary plat is approved with conditions, the applicant shall meet or arrange to meet the conditions and then proceed with the final plat approval process pursuant to Section 26-46.
(3) If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the city clerk shall, within ten days of the council action, record the reasons for disapproval in the minutes of the city council meeting, notify the applicant in writing of the action and the reasons therefor and return the preliminary plat to the applicant.
(j) Effect of preliminary plat approval. Preliminary plat approval shall confer upon the applicant, for a period of two years from the date of approval, the right to proceed to final plat approval and to develop the subject tract or parcel pursuant to the terms and conditions pursuant to which the preliminary plat approval was granted by the city. The two year period may only be extended by the commission and only if the applicant has applied in writing for an extension and the commission determines that a longer period should be granted due to unusual circumstances. If no final plat on any portion of a subdivision for which preliminary approval has been granted is approved within said two year period, or such longer period as the commission may expressly allow, a re-submission of the preliminary plat (or a revised preliminary plat) shall be required pursuant to the then current subdivision regulations and any other applicable land use regulations or requirements. After approval of the preliminary plat, the applicant may proceed to prepare and file a construction plan as may be required for all public facilities and utilities to be provided, and may submit the proposed final plat to the commission for action.

(2) That the final plat conforms to all applicable requirements of these regulations, the zoning ordinance and other applicable land development regulations.
(3) That all submission requirements of these regulations have been satisfied.
(g) If the proposed final plat is approved, the director shall sign the plat. The applicant may then file and record the plat pursuant to Section 26-46(i). If the proposed final plat is dis-approved, the secretary of the commission shall, within ten days of the commission action, record the reasons for disapproval in the minutes of the commission meeting, notify the applicant in writing of the action and the reasons therefore and return the final plat to the applicant.
(h) Effect of final plat approval. Final plat approval shall confer upon the applicant, for a period of five years from the date of approval, the right to apply for building permits and to develop the subject tract or parcel pursuant to the terms and conditions pursuant to which the final plat approval was granted by the commission or council; provided, however, that no final plat shall be filed and recorded unless and until approval by the commission/council has been endorsed thereon. No lot in the subdivision may be sold until the final plat and construction plans have been approved and the plat has been officially recorded. If the final plat is not recorded within 90 days after approval by the commission/council, the commission/council shall formally request the applicant to explain the extenuating circumstances preventing recordation of the final plat. The commission/council shall then determine whether provision of an extension would serve the best interests of the city. If these findings are negative, the commission/council shall revoke approval of the final plat and shall so notify the applicant, the city clerk and the county recorder of deeds.
(i) Filing and recordation. Within 90 days following final plat approval by the commission, the three reproducibles of the final plat shall be filed by the city clerk with the county recorder of deeds; after acknowledgement by the county recorder of deeds one copy shall be retained by the county recorder of deeds and two copies shall be returned to the city clerk, one copy to be retained by the city clerk and the other to be transmitted to the director.

§26-205
(2/1/19)

preliminary or final plat approval. If not paid, and if the final plat is, therefore, not filed within 90 days of approval by the commission, the final plat shall be placed on the commission agenda for further action including, but not limited to, revocation of approval and/or imposition of additional conditions. Only after the final plat is filed by the city clerk shall the city clerk notify the county recorder of deeds to record the copy of the final plat retained by the county recorder of deeds.

(k) Building permits shall not be issued for any structure within the boundaries of the subdivision until all of the required improvements have been constructed and are available to each lot in the subdivision and have been inspected and approved by the director of public works and transportation, or a designee thereof, or until satisfactory completion security in lieu of construction has been formally accepted by the city. A person may provide written notice to the director of community services, or a designee thereof, that a justifiable hardship would be created by the immediate installation of certain required improvements. The director of community services, or a designee thereof, shall determine if, in fact, a hardship is justified and such justification shall be based on the lack of availability of professional services required to install said improvements. Such lack of availability shall not extend beyond a six month time period. Timely construction of the improvements shall commence within one month following the expiration of this six month hardship period. Justifiable hardships based on any reason other than as noted in this section shall be approved, conditionally approved or denied in accordance with Section 26-130, “variances from the subdivision requirements,” or acceptance by the city of satisfactory completion security in lieu of improvements.
(l) Partial building permits, as defined in Section 26-25 “partial building permits”, may be issued by the chief building official prior to the completion of required improvements.

(m) As a condition of the issuance of any permit requested and issued prior to the acceptance by the director of public works and transportation of street, electrical, water, gas, sewer, and other improvements, the developer shall execute a hold harmless and indemnity agreement in a form acceptable to the city attorney. Any such agreement shall provide that the developer agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the city from any cause of action or liability due to city failure to provide any service to the development due to the absence of such improvements.

§26-205
(2/1/19)
CD26:40
provided it is found in writing that the proposed lot line adjustment conforms to local zoning and building ordinances.
(3) The time limits applicable to the approval or conditional approval of subdivisions as provided in Section 26-46(h) herein, shall apply to any such lot line adjustment.
(4) If the proposed lot line adjustment is approved, the director shall sign the record of survey which shall contain a precise legal description of the adjusted property, supplied by the applicant and certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor. Within 90 days following approval by the director, three reproducibles of the lot line adjustment shall be filed by the city clerk with the county recorder of deeds; after acknowledgement by the county recorder of deeds, one copy shall be retained by the county recorder of deeds and two copies shall be returned to the city clerk, one copy to be retained by the city clerk and the other to be transmitted to the director. The applicant(s) shall bear all expenses in connection with the filing and the city clerk shall not be required to file the lot line adjustment until the ap-plicant(s) has paid the required filing fee.
(b) Notice of disapproval. If the proposed lot line adjustment is disapproved, the director shall within 30 days after the application date, notify the applicant in writing of the action and the reasons therefore.
(c) Minor subdivisions not precluded. Nothing in this article shall preclude the applicant from filing a minor subdivision and recording a final plat in lieu of the lot line adjustment procedure.

(2) The proposed subdivision is in compliance with all other provisions of this section and any other ordinances and regulations of the City of St. Joseph and no substandard tract, parcel, or lot will be created;
(3) The proposed lot split will satisfy the conditions set forth in this section without the construction of public streets, water facilities, storm drainage facilities, sanitary sewer, sidewalks and stormwater drainage detention facilities. It is the intent of this provision to limit the administrative approval of lot divisions to those cases in which the improvements required by these regulations already serve each proposed lot. If it is determined that the lot division shall require the addition of public utility easements or additional site improvements, the applicant shall be required to present their proposal to the planning commission or the city council for approval;
(4) The proposed lot split subdivision will not create any non-conforming lots;
(5) The proposed lot split will not result in substantial increase in service requirements, (e.g. utilities, traffic control, parks, schools, streets, nor interfere with the maintenance of existing service levels, e.g. additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.; and if the lot split does result in a substantial increase in service requirements, the applicant shall be required to present their proposal to the planning commission or the city council for approval
(6) The lot split is consistent with the surrounding area and development. In determining consistency, the size dimension of lots previously developed,
SUBDIVISIONS
§26-205
(2/1/19)
CD26:39
the layout and design of existing subdivisions and the degree of deviation from previous development shall be considered; and
(7) A lot of record may only be split or subdivided once using the administrative approval process. If an applicant wishes to further subdivide a previously administratively approved subdivision, the director or his/her designee shall deny the application.

a. Upon a finding by the director or his/her designee that the proposed lot combination does not substantially increase the density of development or does not substantially increase demands on public infrastructure serving existing lots; or
b. The proposed lot combination shall not cause the relocation of any existing public utilities, public utility easements and/or public right-of-way, or
c. The lot combination creates a new lot that is consistent with the surrounding area. In determining consistency, the size and dimension of lots previously developed, the layout and design of existing subdivisions and/or development.
(b) Administrative denial of lot combination. If the director or his/her designee finds that any of the above listed circumstances cannot be met, these representatives shall deny the request for lot combination and cause said application to be submitted for consideration at a regularly scheduled planning commission meeting.

ARTICLE VI. RELIEF
Sec. 26-130. Variances from subdivision requirements.
(a) Authorized. If any mandatory provision of these regulations is shown by the applicant to be unreasonable and to cause undue hardship as applied to the land in a proposed subdivision the council, upon recommendation of the commission, may grant a variance to such applicant from such mandatory provision so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided, that such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations nor adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare and provided that the variance shall be the minimum necessary to accomplish its purposes. In the event that the commission shall render a tie vote on any recommendation, said vote shall represent a recommendation for denial of the request for relief. In the event of a recommendation of denial of the variance request by the commission, a two-thirds majority vote of the city council will be required to grant a variance.
(b) Conditions. In granting variances, the council may impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied.
(c) Findings of fact for variance approvals. No variance shall be granted unless it is found that all of the following apply:
(1) There are special and unusual circumstances affecting said property such that the strict application of the provisions of this article would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his land, and is not the mere grant of a privilege not granted to others, and
(2) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the owner, and

Sec. 26-140. Short title.
This ordinance shall be known and cited as the "St. Joseph Transportation User Fee Regulations."
(G.O. 2264, 1-14-08)
Sec. 26-141. Findings.
The City Council of St. Joseph, Missouri, hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The comprehensive plan for the city, "Land Use Plan of the City of St. Joseph, Missouri, adopted April 25, 2005, and amended from time to time, and census and population studies to date indicate that growth will continue throughout the upcoming years and will place additional demands on the city to provide transportation facilities to support new development.
(c) Funds collected pursuant to the St. Joseph Transportation User Fee Ordinance shall be expended only on transportation facilities and facility expansions within the transportation road user fee service area from which the property is located, with respect to which the road user fee was paid.
(d) The transportation facilities and facility expansions constructed within each service area have a "rational nexus" to and provide a benefit to those properties with respect to which fees are imposed pursuant to this article.
(e) It is the intent of this article that, by establishment of transportation user fees, new development in the city will pay its fair share of the cost of transportation facilities and facility expansions required to serve such new development and that the fees paid with respect to each new development are, based on an individualized determination, roughly
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§26-205
(2/1/19)
CD26:40
proportionate, both in nature and extent, to the demand that such new development will have on transportation facilities.
(f) It is the intent of this article that the transportation facilities and expansions financed through the transportation impact fees established hereby be based, when applicable, upon the city's comprehensive plan, major street plan, and capital improvement program and are consistent therewith.
(g) The city council has considered the matter of financing of new transportation facilities and facility expansions, the need for which is necessitated by new development. The council hereby finds and declares that a transportation user fee imposed upon new development to finance city transportation facilities and facility expansions, the need for which is reasonably related to the new development, furthers the public health, safety and welfare of St. Joseph. Therefore, the city council deems it advisable to adopt the St. Joseph Transportation User Fee Ordinance as hereinafter set forth.
(G.O. 2264, 1-14-08)
Sec. 26-142. Intent.
(a) The St. Joseph Transportation User Fee Ordinance is intended to impose a user's fee upon the approval of a final plat, if a final plat must be approved prior to issuance of a building permit pursuant to the St. Joseph Land Development Code, or to the issuance of a building permit, if approval of a final plat is not so required, in an amount based upon the demand for transportation facilities or facility expansions attributable to the new development and the cost of providing such facilities necessary to serve new development. The user fee shall be payable upon issuance of a building permit. This article shall not be construed to authorize imposition of fees for transportation facilities or facility expansions the need for which is attributable to existing development or "pass through" traffic.
(b) The intent of this article is to establish a system of user's fees, as "user's fees" are interpreted in recent Missouri case law, that will be used to pay for the cost of providing transportation facilities and facility expansions, the demand for which is generated by new development. The amount of the user's fee to be paid by each new development is calculated to be directly proportionate to the demand for transportation facilities and facility expansions created by each such new development. This article is specifically designed so as not to establish a "tax" or "fee," as such terms are used in Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, but rather as a mechanism to equitably shift the burden of the cost of such facilities and expansions from the existing general public (which has already paid its fair share of the cost of the existing network of roads and roadways and the associated appurtenances and which will continue to pay for the cost of maintenance and repair of such existing roadways through funds other than those derived from the system of user's fees) to new development that will generate the need for the transportation facilities and facility expansions that will be provided by monies derived from this system of user's fees. The monies collected from imposition of this system of user's fees are to be used to offset the cost of providing services to new development in the form of transportation facilities and facility expansions and the system is designed to ensure that such monies collected may only be expended to provide such services. The monies may not be paid into the city's general fund to defray customary governmental expenditures. In addition, the system is designed so that the user's fee:
(1) is paid upon the approval of designated development applications not periodically; and
(2) is required to be expended for the provision of transportation facilities that directly benefit the person who has generated the need for such facilities within a reasonable period of time from the date such fee is paid; and
(3) is directly proportional in amount to the transportation services provided; and
(4) is for a service that has not historically been provided exclusively by monies derived from taxes.
(c) Towards this end, the transportation user fee adopted pursuant to this article is based upon the calculation methodology described in the "St. Joseph Transportation Facilities User Fee Report," which report is hereby incorporated by

(1) determine the applicability of this article to the property for which the application is received within 14 working days of receipt of the application by the director;
(2) if this article is not applicable, the director shall notify the applicant within 14 days of receipt of application by director of said inapplicability, and shall process the application in accordance with all relevant city ordinances and regulations;
(3) If this article is applicable, the director shall preliminarily calculate and assess the amount of the transportation user fee that will be imposed on the proposed new development pursuant to this article by multiplying the user fee rate by the number of service units for the proposed development with respect to which the approval is being sought. This assessment shall be an estimate only for the benefit of the applicant and shall be subject to final determination at the time the applicant requests final plat approval or a building permit for property which does not require approval of a plat prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(b) All preliminary plats approvals subject to this article, and with respect to all proposed new development that does not require approval of a preliminary plat, all development approvals that are the last discretionary approval required by city ordinances and regulations prior to issuance of a building permit subject to this article, shall be conditioned on the payment of the user fee imposed pursuant to this article.
(c) The imposition of the transportation user fee does not alter, negate, supersede or otherwise affect any of the requirements of the city, including the city zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations and county, state or federal legislation or regulations that may be applicable to a development, which may impose roadway system related requirements, rights-of-way dedication requirements and design and construction standards for roadways.

Sec. 26-150. Computation of road user fee.
(a) Upon receipt of an application for a building permit or final plat approval for a new development subject to this article, in such instances where final plat approval is required, the director shall calculate the amount of the applicable transportation user fee due by:
(1) Multiplying the number of service units generated by the new development by the user fee rate per service unit for the service area using Schedule 1, which is on file in the office of the city clerk. The number of service units shall be determined by using the conversion table contained therein;
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§26-205
(2/1/19)
CD26:40
(2) The amount of each transportation user fee due shall be reduced by any allowable credits, in the manner provided in this section of this article.
(3) The total amount of the transportation user fee due for the new development shall be calculated and attached to the final plat or a building permit application, as the case may be, as a condition of approval.
(b) Transportation user fees shall be collected at the time an application for a building permit is filed and accepted by the city for a development with respect to which this article is applicable.
(c) If the building permit for which a transportation user fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the transportation user fee due shall be computed using Schedule 1, which is on file in the office of the city clerk, then in effect, with credits for previous payments of fees being applied against the new fees due.
(d) A building permit application or application for final plat approval must be resubmitted to the director and the amount of the transportation user fee recalculated if the applicant alters the proposed development in such a way as to result in an increased number of service units. In that case, the initial user impact fee collected for that new service unit shall be determined by using Schedule 1, which is on file in the office of the city clerk, then in effect, and such additional fees shall be collected upon application for a new building permit or application for final plat approval submitted.
(G.O. 2264, 1-14-08)

(b) The city shall credit escrow fees deposited with the city for transportation facilities prior to the effective date against the amount of the transportation user fee due, subject to guidelines provided by the director.
(c) All credits against transportation user fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted pursuant to this article and additional standards promulgated by the city consistent with and in implementation of this article, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines:
(1) No credit shall be given for dedication or construction of on-site facilities.
(2) The unit cost used to calculate the credit shall not exceed those assumed for the transportation facilities included in the applicable transportation user fees capital improvements plan.
(3) No credit shall be given for transportation facilities or facility expansions that are not included in the applicable transportation user fee capital improvements plan. Credit may only be given for the dedication of right-of-way or construction of facilities made and/or completed and accepted by the city after the effective date.
(4) Credits given for new developments pursuant to this article , which have received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article, shall be reduced by subtracting an amount equal to the transportation user fees that would have been paid by the applicant for the number of existing service units using Schedule 1 to this article.
(5) If a credit applicable to a plat has not been exhausted within five years from the date of the acquisition of the first building permit issued with respect to that plat or within any period as may be otherwise designated by contract, the credit shall lapse.

The decision shall specify the maximum value of the credit that may be applied against a transportation user fee, which amount and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat or the building permit for the new development, as the case may be.
(e) The available credit associated with the plat shall be applied against a transportation user fee in the following manner:
(1) For single-family residential lots in a new development that has received final plat approval only of single-family residential lots, such credit shall be prorated equally among those lots and shall remain applicable to those lots, to be applied at the time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit.
(2) For all other types of new development, including those involving mixed uses, which have received final plat approval, the credit applicable to the plat shall be applied to the transportation user fee due at the time of acceptance by the city of the first building permit to which the credit is applicable, and thereafter to all subsequent building permits applications accepted until the credit has been exhausted.
(3) At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit agreements upon petition by the owner or developer in accordance with the guidelines provided by the director.

Sec. 28-7. Emergency traffic regulations.
(a) Driving emergency, phase I. When slippery or other hazardous driving conditions are in existence, including but not limited to snow, sleet or freezing rain, which may lead to traffic congestion, the city manager or his designate may declare a driving emergency. Until such driving emergency is terminated, no person shall operate a motor vehicle on any street or boulevard in such a manner or in such conditions as to allow, cause or permit such vehicle to become stalled because of that fact that driving wheels are not equipped with all-season tires, snow tires or chains. Failure to have all-season tires, snow tires or chains installed on such vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. When such driving emergency is deemed to exist, the city manager or his designate shall give notice thereof by announcing to the public through the news media and the police chief or his designate the date and time of its commencement. The verbal notice shall thereafter be confirmed by written order from the city manager directed to the judge of the municipal court, police chief and city clerk.

When circumstances exist or are reasonably contemplated to exist in the immediately foreseeable future, including but not limited to actual or anticipated snow removal operations, the city manager or his designate may declare a parking emergency. Until such parking emergency is terminated, no vehicle shall be parked on any emergency route, as defined in Subsection (c) of this section. Within two hours after the declaration by the city manager or his designate, all vehicles shall be removed from the streets and boulevards designated in Subsection (c) of this section. Notice of the declaration shall be given as set out in Subsection (a) of this section. At the discretion of the director of public works and transportation, a parking emergency upon any of the streets and boulevards designated in Subsection (c) of this section may be terminated at such time as a parking emergency shall cease to exist upon certain streets and boulevards without regard to a parking emergency which may exist on other streets and boulevards.

(9) The motor vehicle was present in the intersection because it was inoperable.
(e) Notice to defendant.
(1) Service of summons and other information. Upon the filing of an information in the Municipal Division of the Circuit Court a summons shall be issued, with a court date established, pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 37. The summons shall be served together with the following:

A statement that, if at the time and place of the violation, the motor vehicle was being operated by a person other than the owner, or the vehicle or the license plate captured by the automated traffic control system record was stolen, the owner may submit by affidavit on a form provided by the City prior to the proceeding, or under oath at the proceeding, information to that effect and concerning the actual driver of the vehicle or the vehicles or license plates status as stolen.
(3) Presumption of Service. A violation notice and summons mailed under this section is presumed to have been received by the owner on the fifth day after the date of violation notice is mailed.
(4) Action based on supplemental information.

(g) No pre-emption of other provisions. Nothing within this section is intended to pre-empt the use of any other statute, ordinance or other applicable law or regulation by a person authorized to enforce this chapter, except that a violation of this section shall not be prosecuted if the owner or other proper defendant is also accused of committing a violation of Section 28-139 of this code.

Sec. 29-133. Purpose and policy.
(a) The purpose of this division is to adopt uniform requirements for the use of the city sewers and sewage treatment facilities and to regulate the use of public and private sewers and drains, private sewage disposal, the installation and connection of building sewers, the discharge of waters and wastes into the public sewer system, the discharge of water and wastes into natural outlets and to provide penalties for violations thereof.
(b) This division also sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the city wastewater collection system and WPF and thereby enable the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR 403), and provides for penalties for violations thereof. The objectives of the general pretreatment regulations and of this division are to:
(1) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2) Protect the general public and city personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment;
(3) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(4) Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludge from the system; and
(5) Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal wastewater system.
(c) This division provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits, application of BMPs, and other control mechanisms to certain significant nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting and assumes that existing customer's capacity will not be preempted. Fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established in this division will be enumerated in Division 4 of this article.
(d) This division shall apply to persons within the territorial limits of the city and to persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city treatment works. Except as otherwise provided in this division, the director shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this division.

Sec. 29-158. Pretreatment.
(a) Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment or flow equalization facilities as required to comply with this division and other requirements imposed by the director and shall achieve compliance with all pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the applicable pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
(b) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user's at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
(c) The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable, pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" means:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in Sections 29-157 and 29-159 of the code for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in Sections 29-157 and 29-159 of the code multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);

§29-218
(5/1/19)
CD29:38
(3) Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by Sections 29-157 and 29-159 of the code that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public;
(4) Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within 90 calendar days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance;
(6) Failure to provide within 30 calendar days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8) Any other violation that the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(d) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1) Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, bath or other). If the industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during the calendar month and an estimate of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 calendar days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted as provided in this section. The notification require-ment in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of this chapter.
(2) Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection (d)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
(3) Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(4) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
UTILITIES
§29-219
(5/1/19)
CD29:39
substance within 90 calendar days of the effective date of such regulations.
(5) In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(Gen. Ord. No. 1049, § 1(23-77(c)), 12-7-92; G.O. 1742, 1-10-00; G.O. 2407, 10-18-10; G.O. 2735, 6-23-14)
Sec. 29-159. National categorical pretreatment standards; local limits.
(a) Adopted. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated, as though fully set out herein.
(b) Limits. All users shall comply with flow limits and pollutant discharge limits stated in wastewater discharge permits issued to them.
(c) Mass and concentration conversion – when allowed. The city may convert the limits of the categorical pretreatment standards at 40 CFR parts 414, 419, and 455 from mass limits to concentration limits, or from concentration limits to mass limits, for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual users only when, in ,converting such limits, the city uses the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR parts 414, 419, and 455 and documents that dilution is not being substituted for treatment.
(d) Mass and concentration conversion - method. Pollutant discharge limits in categorical pretreatment standards may be expressed either as concentration or mass limits. Where concentration limits are specified, the city may, in its discretion, provide equivalent mass limits and where mass limits are specified, the city may, in its discretion, provide equivalent concentration limits. When such equivalent limits are provided, local, state or federal authorities responsible for enforcement may use either concentration or mass limits as a basis for enforcement. Limits in the categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the effluent of the process regulated by the standard, or as otherwise specified by the standard.
(1) Calculation method – concentration-to-mass. Equivalent mass limitations that are calculated based upon concentration limits shall be calculated by multiplying the applicable mass limit by the individual user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term daily production (such as the average daily production during a representative year) rather than the user’s designed production capacity. For new sources provided by a user, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.
(2) Calculation method – mass-to-concentration. Equivalent concentration limitations that are calculated based upon mass limitations shall be calculated by dividing the applicable mass limitations by the individual user's average daily flow rate of regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term average flow rate (such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year).
(e) User-requested conversions. When categorical pretreatment standard limits are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the city; however, the city may establish equivalent mass limits upon the user’s request only if the user:
(1) Employs, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce or otherwise limit water use during the term of any applicable control mechanism;
(2) Currently uses control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and has not used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
(3) Provides sufficient information to establish the user's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§29-218
(5/1/19)
CD29:38
data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and long-term average production rate must be representative of then-current operating conditions;
(4) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and
(5) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(f) Equivalent mass limit requirements. A user subject to equivalent mass limits which have been converted from concentration limits must:
(1) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
(2) Record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(3) Record the facility's production rates and notify the City whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from baseline production rates. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the City may reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(4) Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
(g) Conversion exceptions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, limits for pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass, including, but not limited to pH, temperature, and radiation must be limited in terms of concentration and may not be limited in terms of mass.
(h) Compliance with conversions. Conversions of mass and concentration are deemed pretreatment standards pursuant to this code. The city will document how conversions were derived. Once incorporated into a user’s permit or other control mechanism, the user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
(i) Maximum discharge. When categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4-day average limitations, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the daily discharge and the average.
(j) Significant changes. Any user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the city within two (2) business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the city of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.
(k) Variances. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(l) Net gross adjustments. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

Sec. 29-160. Excessive discharge; dilution prohibited.
(a) Dilution prohibited. Except as specifically allowed in this section, no user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in any pretreatment standards or in any
UTILITIES

Sec. 29-161. Accidental discharges.
(a) Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by pretreatment standards or this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan within 120 calendar days from the effective date of this division. All users shall complete this plan prior to issuance of the wastewater discharge permit.
(b) No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division.
(c) For an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions.
(d) Within five working days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measure to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law.
(e) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a dangerous discharge occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(f) Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan, failure to comply will constitute a violation of this section. The director shall review and approve or require additional information within 45 working days of receipt. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.
(2) Description of stored chemicals.
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge.
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

CD29:38
the limitation variance to the director at the hearing.
(f) Step 5.
(1) The director shall notify the user of his preliminary findings and decisions within 20 working days of the limitation variance hearing. The director shall base his preliminary decision and subsequent final decision on the user's limitation variance request on the following considerations:
a. The effects the discharge of the specific pollutants, for which a variance is being requested, will have on the operation of the POTW or on the disposal of sludge.
b. The removal capabilities of the city's POTW and evaluation if the pollutant will pass through the treatment works untreated into receiving streams.
c. The city's capability to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludges resulting from wastewater treatment.
d. Any state or federal discharge requirement for the specific pollutant.
e. Health and safety considerations of city workers at the POTW treatment works, pumping stations or collection stations.
f. The capability of the city's POTW to meet NPDES permit discharge requirements.
(2) The director may:
a. Deny the request for a limitation variance.
b. Approve the request for a limitation variance.
c. Conditionally approve the request for a limitation variance. Conditional approval of a limitation variance request may be issued by the director for a specific time period. The director may establish a specific concentration of pollutant the user may discharge and may establish a limitation variance charge for the conditional approval of discharge of pollutants. The limitations variance charge the user is assessed shall be based upon:
1. Recovery of additional operation and maintenance costs incurred by the city's POTW as a result of the user limitation variance.
2. Recovery of any damage to pumps, laboratory equipment, computers or any other equipment at the POTW treatment works, pump stations or collection systems.
3. Additional equipment or manpower necessary for or associated with treatment of the pollutants allowed under the limitation variance.
The limitation variance charge shall be adjusted periodically by the director to allow for the recovery of costs described in this subsection.
(g) Step 6. Within ten working days of notification of the director's preliminary findings and decisions, the user must submit any additional data the user feels the director should evaluate for his final decision. The information must contain a clear and concise statement which specifically states how the data supports the users request for a limitation variance.
(h) Step 7. The director will notify the user of the final decision on the limitation variance request. This notification shall include a written summary of the director's evaluation of the limitation variance request.
(i) Step 8. Within 30 calendar days of the final notification from the director, the user must submit and have approved a compliance schedule to meet the pretreatment standards or cease contributing to the POTW. The compliance schedule shall conform to Section 29-193.
(j) Step 9. After approval of the compliance schedule, the director shall issue a wastewater discharge permit.
(Gen. Ord. No. 1007, § 1(23-78(b)(3)), 8-17-92; G.O. 1742, 1-10-00; G.O. 2720, 3-3-14)

existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(Gen. Ord. No. 1007, § 1(23-78(b)(6)), 8-17-92; G.O. 1742, 1-10-00)
Sec. 29-191. Transferability.
Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 30 calendar days advance notice to the director and the director approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the director must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which:
(1) States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility’s operations and processes;
(2) Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
(3) Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.

(c) Final compliance report. Within 90 calendar days following the date for final compliance as determined by the compliance schedule in the wastewater discharge permit or as promulgated by categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, after 60 calendar days of commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by the pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for the process units in the user facility which are limited by the pretreatment standards or requirements. The final compliance report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional manufacturing, processes, housekeeping procedures, operation and maintenance procedures or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(1).
(d) Periodic compliance reports (semiannual reports).
(1) All significant industrial users must submit certified laboratory reports from an independent laboratory. Any user who has been issued a waste-water contribution permit or any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless the director requires more or unless required more frequently in the categorical pretreatment standard, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent discharged to the POTW which are limited by pretreatment standards or this division. The user must submit certified laboratory reports from a qualified independent laboratory. This report shall include estimated average and maximum daily flows and estimates of the daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow reported to the city. This report shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a) (2)(ii) and shall be signed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(1) by all users issued a wastewater discharge permit or subject to categorical pretreatment standards. At the discretion of the director and in consideration of such factors as holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director may agree to alter the months during which such reports are to be submitted.
(2) In cases where the director has imposed mass limitations on users, the periodic compliance report shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the director pursuant to section 304(g) of the act and contained in 40 CFR 136 or with any other test procedures approved by the director.
(e) Sample collection and analysis.
(1) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(2) Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the director. Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling

and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the director. Samples shall be obtained by a flow proportion 24-hour composite sampler. Where such sampling is not feasible, grab samples or composite samples may be taken only if approved by director. The user will take a minimum of three composite samples during a two-week period which are representative of the user discharge. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(3) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(4) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring reports required in Section 29-188 and 90 day compliance reports required in this section [40CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For periodic compliance reports in this section (40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)), the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

and Remedies
Sec. 29-216. Harmful contributions.
(a) The director may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or which presents, or may present, an endangerment or to the environment.
(b) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 29-193 of this article are initiated against the user.
(c) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 29-218 through 29-221 of this article.
(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

(b) In addition to other available remedies, any user of the city's POTW who is required by this division to have a wastewater discharge permit shall be subject to suspension of the permit by the director if it shall appear to the director that an actual or threatened violation of this division, state or federal laws or regulations or the permit granted to such user has or is about to occur.
(c) Any person that is notified of a suspension of his wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop contributing to the city's POTW system. If the user fails to voluntarily comply with the suspension order, the city, in order to prevent or minimize damage to the city's POTW system, may take such steps as are deemed necessary, including severance of the user's sewer connection.
(d) The payment of a limit fee shall not be construed as a limit on enforcement measures that may be taken for the violation of a limit stated in a wastewater discharge permit. The director is hereby authorized to propose, adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations establishing the applicability of enforcement actions to users who have exceeded limits stated in a wastewater discharge permit, provided such rules are based solely on the frequency, duration, and impact of the discharge that exceeded the permit limit, and other reasonable factors related to discharges that exceed permit limits.

Sec. 29-218. Enforcement action.
(a) Verbal telephone notice (VTN). A verbal telephone notice is the first step of notifying the industry of a violation and can be used as the only enforcement action for a minor violation.
(b) Site visit (SV). A site visit can be used in conjunction with any other enforcement action to ensure that requirements to return to compliance or ensure that noncompliance is not occurring. This can be used for enforcement or to respond to a report by, but not limited to, the following individuals:
(1) Citizens noticing a violation;
(2) City employees;
(3) Employees of an industry seeing a violation; or
(4) Any other individual that notices a violation.
(c) Compliance Schedules. When an industry is in a state of noncompliance and after a series of resampling for the pollutant that resulted in noncompliance or a series of other actions to identify noncompliance, then said industry will submit to the superintendent and pretreatment coordinator its plan to return to compliance. Such plan shall comply with the following:
(1) Progress increments-required. Progress increments shall be included in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment facilities or other measures required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation) or other applicable requirements. No increments referred to herein shall be scheduled in excess of nine months apart. If a progress increment is missed by more than 30 calendar days and the industry cannot demonstrate good cause, said industry will be considered in significant noncompliance, which will be considered an additional violation, and additional steps may be taken to ensure future compliance.
(2) Progress reports. The user under a compliance schedule shall submit a progress report to the director no later than 14 days following each progress increment date in the schedule and on or about the final date of compliance. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, a statement of whether the user complied with the progress increment, the reason for any delay, if any, and, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule (if delayed). If a report is more than 30 calendar days late,
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§29-218
(5/1/19)

the industry will be considered in significant noncompliance, which will be considered an additional violation, and additional steps may be taken to ensure future compliance.
(d) Notice of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written “notice of violation (NOV)”. Within 15 calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(e) Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(f) Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten working days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(g) Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(h) Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(i) Administrative fines.
(1) When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user between a minimum amount of $1,000.00 per day, per occurrence up to $37,500.00 per day per occurrence to conform with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(vi)(A) requirements. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to appeal the fine within 30 calendar days of being notified of the fine. The written request must state the factual basis for the appeal. When a request is properly filed, the city manager shall convene a hearing on the matter. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. The city manager shall issue a decision within 15 working days following the conclusion of the hearing. A decision not to rescind an administrative fine, shall be considered the final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. Users seeking judicial review may initiate judicial review by filing a petition in the circuit court of Buchanan County, Missouri, within thirty days after the mailing or delivery of the notice of the city manager’s final decision.
(3) The city manager, with the written concurrence of the city attorney and the director of administrative services, may enter into an agreement or issue an order authorizing a credit to a sewer service account, provided a user which has been issued an administrative fine agrees to perform tasks that mitigate the effect of the violation, limit the possibility of a future violation, or otherwise provide public benefit.
(4) The city manager, with the written concurrence of the city attorney and the director of administrative services, may issue a credit to a sewer service account,

provided a user which has been issued an administrative fine has entered into an agreement with the city or received an order from the city manager to perform tasks that mitigate the effect of the violation, limit the possibility of a future violation, or otherwise provide public benefit and has successfully completed those tasks.
(5) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(j) Emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present, a danger to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the director, that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment, shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(k) Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violations of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; and
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards listed in this article.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under this article as to why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Sec. 29-219. Judicial remedies.
(a) Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the circuit court of Buchanan County, Missouri, through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(b) Civil penalties.
(1) A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty between a minimum amount of $1,000.00 per day, per occurrence up to $32,500.00 per day, per occurrence to conform with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(vi)(A) requirements. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(2) The director may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(3) In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice requires.
(4) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(c) Criminal prosecution.
(1) A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
(2) A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine of not more than $500.00, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(3) A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

Sec. 29-220. Supplemental enforcement actions.
(a) Performance bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(b) Liability insurance. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
(c) Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(d) Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the city code, as stated in Chapter 15 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.
(e) Contractor listing. Users, which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the director.

Sec. 29-221. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a) Upset.
(1) For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of Subsection (c), below, are met.
(3) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that:
a. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
UTILITIES
§29-219
(5/1/19)
CD29:39
b. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c. The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five working days:
1. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.
2. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
(6) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(b) Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 29-156 of this article or the specific prohibitions in Section 29-157 of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(c) Bypass.
(1) For the purposes of this section:
a. “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.
b. “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of Subsections (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.
(3) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten working days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§29-218
(5/1/19)
CD29:38
submission shall also be provided within five working days of the time that the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4) Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless:
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage;
b. There were not feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c. The user submitted notices as required under Subsection (c)(3) of this section.
(5) The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection (c)(4)a. of this section.

Sec. 29-236. Wastewater sampling and billing calculation method.
The provisions contained in this section shall apply to surcharges and other pollutant-based billing amounts described in this division.
(a) Sampling and analysis.
(1) Procedure. Analysis of wastewater discharge samples taken for the purposes of calculating a surcharge or limit fee billed pursuant to this division shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of this section and other standard requirements established by the director.
(2) Basis for charges. Charges based upon pollutants contained in wastewater shall be based upon wastewater samples taken from the user’s wastewater discharge. The wastewater samples taken to determine the charges imposed by this division shall be taken daily or may, if approved by the director, be taken on any three or more days during a billing month as those days are selected by the superintendent.
(b) Total monthly pollutant discharge calculation. For the purposes of determining surcharges and limit fees billed pursuant to this division, the pounds of discharge of each pollutant for which such charges are issued shall be determined as described below.
(1) Daily sample users. For users whose wastewater is sampled and analyzed on a daily, or near daily, basis, the user’s total pollutant discharge (in pounds) shall be calculated as described below:
a. Daily total pollutant discharge calculation. On each day during which a valid wastewater sample and analysis is available, pounds of pollutant content contained in wastewater shall be calculated using the following method:
Pollutant content [stated in mg/l] multiplied by gallons of wastewater discharged on that day multiplied by 8.34 divided by 1,000,000.
b. Unavailable or invalid samples and analysis. If samples or analysis are unavailable or invalid for any day or days during the billing month, the total pounds of pollutants determined to be in the user’s wastewater on such day or days shall be:

Sec. 29-237. Schedule and application of user charges.
(a) General provisions.
(1) Sewer use and treatment charge levied. There is levied a sewage treatment and sewer user charge upon all sewage system users in accordance with the schedules in this section based upon the wastewater discharge as being discharge of a commercial user, industrial user, residential user, wholesale user, or hauled wastewater user.
(2) Effective dates. All detailed rates and limits described in this section below shall be applicable to sewer use billed after July 1, 2017. All sewer use charges billed prior to July 1, 2017, shall be due based upon the rates and limits applicable at the time such sewer use charges were initially billed.
(3) Implementation. When this section cannot be strictly implemented based upon the nature of a user’s use or when strict implementation would cause unreasonable cost or effort based upon the billed charges that would be collected, the director may authorize reasonable alternative methods of implementation and calculation of charges, provided such charges are amounts similar to the charges the user would incur if this section were strictly implemented. The director may further authorize reasonable alternative methods of implementing the surcharge and limit fee provisions of this section when necessary to temporarily accommodate new user processes that do not substantially increase the city’s total cost of wastewater treatment.
(4) User types. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed below:
a. Commercial users or commercial customers means users of the city’s POTW that are not industrial or wholesale users, but that discharge wastewater from buildings or structures which are used primarily for purposes other than single family residential or individually-metered residential purposes.
b. Industrial users or industrial customers means users of the city’s POTW that are industrial users pursuant to this chapter, but which are not wholesale users.
c. Residential users or residential customers means users of the city’s POTW that (1) discharge wastewater from buildings or structures used exclusively for residential purposes and (2) are reported by a Public Service Commission-regulated water supplier as residential in nature if such suppliers report the user’s water use for the purposes of sewer billing.
d. Wholesale users or wholesale customers means users of the city’s POTW that are wholesale users as such users are defined in this chapter.
e. Hauled wastewater users or hauled wastewater customers means users of the city’s WPF which deliver wastewater directly to the WPF using an automobile or trailer-mounted tank, but who do not utilize the city’s POTW collection system.
The type of user described above shall be based upon the physical location of the use and not on the same person’s or entity’s sewer use at other locations.
(5) User classes. For the purposes of applying sewer user charges, wholesale users are deemed to be part of the wholesale customer class and all other

ARTICLE V. PUBLIC UTILITY RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
Sec. 29-350. Intent.
The city council finds that the enactment of a Right-of-Way Management Ordinance will have a beneficial impact on all of the citizens of the city. The use of the right-of-way is increasing due to the advancements in technology, changes in federal and state law and increased demand for services from residents, businesses, educational institutions, governmental offices located in the city and other public and private institutions. The city council further finds that the public convenience, health, safety and welfare can be best served by establishing regulatory power and procedures to protect the right-of-way, ensure the orderly development of infrastructure which effectively serves the city, while at the same time not creating barriers which prohibit or effectively prohibit competition. The city council further finds that such regulatory powers should be vested in the city or such persons as the city shall designate. This article further addresses the various regulatory schemes as may be imposed by state and federal law as to distinct types of right-of-way users.

A franchise shall be obtained by a right-of-way user seeking to use of the right-of-way for purposes of providing or distribution or supply of light, water, electricity, heat, gas, steam, or sewer public utility service in the city or as may be otherwise required by city charter, subject to any applicable superseding law. Such franchise shall be obtained prior to any use of the right-of-way and shall be granted only in conformance with the franchise procedures and requirements set forth in Article XIII of the city charter, after public hearing and on satisfaction of all other applicable ordinances and requirements.
(2) Right-of-way use agreement. A right-of-way use agreement shall be required for all other right-of-way users, except as provided herein or applicable law. Such agreements shall conform to all applicable law but shall not be subject to
procedures applicable to franchises and the council may authorize form agreements that may be executed by the city administrator in substantially the form approved by council ordinance.
(b) The authority granted by the city in any agreement or franchise shall be for nonexclusive use of the right-of-way, unless otherwise provided therein consistent with applicable law. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other rights to use the right-of-way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to all applicable law.
(c) An application for franchise or right-of-way use agreement shall be presented to the director in writing and shall include all such information as is provided for on an initial registration application pursuant to Section 29-353 for right-of-way users.

(5/1/19)
CD29:39
this article and all applicable law, the city shall execute such approved form franchise or right-of-way use agreement (or modified agreement otherwise acceptable to the city consistent with the purposes of this article), and such executed franchise or agreement shall constitute consent to use the right-of-way; provided that nothing herein shall preclude the rejection or modification of any executed franchise or agreement submitted to the city to the extent such applicable law does not prohibit such rejection or modification such as where necessary to reasonably and in a uniform or nondiscriminatory manner reflect the distinct engineering, construction, operation, maintenance or public work or safety requirements applicable to the applicant.
(d) Unless otherwise provided herein or by law, use or installation of any facilities in, on or over public lands of the city not constituting right-of-way shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms and conditions as the city may require.
(e) The city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of right-of-way and shall not be liable for any damages therefrom. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon the right-of-way user. The right-of-way user shall be solely liable for any damages to facilities or other property due to excavation, facilities maintenance, or other work performed prior to obtaining the location of all facilities that have been properly identified prior to such work. The right-of-way user shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed Facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities.
(f) As a condition for use of the right-of-way, a right-of-way user shall have no damages, remedy, or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any right-of-way use agreement, franchise, or special permit, or because of the enforcement thereof by said city, or from the use of right-of-way. Nothing herein shall preclude the right-of-way user from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the city where such relief is otherwise available and the requirements therefor are otherwise satisfied.
(g) No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property and no person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location of any facilities in the right-of-way shall be a vested interest or property right.

Sec. 29-357. Design and location of facilities.
(a) The construction plans and specifications required by Subsection 29-355(b) and Subsection 29-355(c) shall comply with all law and the code including, but not limited to, the rules and
UTILITIES
§29-219
(5/1/19)
CD29:39
regulations adopted by the public works and transportation director pursuant to Chapter 25, Article II, Division 3 of the code. The design shall not provide for the disruption or interference with any other facilities or public improvement. The design, location, and nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the director of the department of public works and transportation to the extent permitted by law. Such review shall be on a non-discriminatory basis in application of city policy (including Article V of Chapter 25 relating to poles, wires and conduits) and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. City height limitations, applicable zoning restrictions, and general city policies with regard to all users of the right-of-way shall be applicable to all facilities.
(b) Except as provided herein or where prohibited by applicable law, no person may erect, construct, or install facilities above the surface of the right-of-way without the written permission of the city based on good cause established by applicant and found by the city. In addition, all new fiber optics, coaxial, and similar cable facilities shall be located within existing conduit, trenches, or other facilities to minimize unnecessary use of right-of-way space, reduce potential existing or future interference and obstructions, and to reduce the cost to the public or others therefrom, and to maximize the public’s ability to use and license appropriate private or public uses of the right-of-way in the public interest except where preempted by law or where good cause is established and written permission granted by the city. Such permission may be granted by the city council when other similar facilities exist above-ground and conditions are such that underground construction is impossible, impractical or unfeasible, as determined by the city, and when in the city's judgment the above-ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed. Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate right-of-way exists, the right-of-way user shall place above-ground facilities underground in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible. New utility poles and related ground mounted equipment shall be permitted to be installed above ground; provided, however, that to ensure unobstructed pedestrian use and city maintenance of the right-of-way and minimize visual obstructions or a “clear zone” for vehicular traffic, a new utility pole and any ground mounted equipment related to that utility pole or the equipment thereon shall not be installed within 150 feet of another utility pole or other ground mounted equipment on the same side of the right-of-way. A replacement utility pole that is installed in lieu of an existing utility pole and is installed within ten feet of the existing utility pole, shall not be considered a new utility pole subject to the spacing requirements herein. Such spacing regulations as applied to that specific site may be altered by the public works and transportation director upon good cause shown by the applicant including: (1) when and where nearby utility poles exist that are spaced closer than 150 feet apart; (2) when conditions are such that no existing structure is available for placement of facilities; and (3) the utility pole can be placed to be minimally visually intrusive.
(c) Except where prohibited by applicable law, the public works and transportation director shall assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for facilities, that are, or pursuant to current technology the director expects will someday be, located in right-of-way. All facilities shall be designed and constructed in the proper corridor as designated by the public works and transportation director pursuant to the authority contained in this article. All persons whose facilities are located in right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the director shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move the facilities to the proper corridor designated by the director.
(d) All construction or maintenance of facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the right-of-way. Specifically, every applicant shall utilize trenchless technology and specify the use of trenchless technology in the design of projects located below or under pavements or other locations that will require cutting or patching of right-of-way. Except when prohibited by applicable law, if and when the city requires a right-of-way user to cease using existing poles, all other right-of-way users utilizing the same poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time. The cost of such relocations shall be borne in accordance with this article and approved applicable tariffs

governing that right-of-way user. The design of each project shall be the design that will result in the least amount of disruptions to the right-of-way.
(e) All right-of-way users shall construct and maintain its facilities so as not to interfere with other users of the right-of-way. The right-of-way user shall not interfere with or alter the facilities of the city or other right-of-way user without their consent and shall be solely responsible for such. All facilities and other structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners, right-of-way users, and the city. Facilities and other structures shall not be placed where they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities, structures, or public improvements or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the city or public improvements. Above-ground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the public works and transportation director may require as alternatives to the proposed work either less disruptive methods or different locations for facilities consistent with applicable law.
(f) Pursuant to city authority, including Section 67.1830(6)(f) RSMo. and the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (§§ 67.5110 et seq. RSMo.), and to properly manage the limited space in the city’s right-of-way, minimize obstructions and interference with the use of the right-of-way by the public and to ensure public safety, while also seeking to facilitate delivery of broadband technologies to city residents and businesses, wireless facilities shall be permitted in the right-of-way in compliance with the requirements applicable to other facilities and users in the right-of-way, and the additional requirements set forth in this section for wireless antennas and facilities.
(1) Any wireless facility in the right-of-way shall be subject to conditions relating to the location (including prohibited or limited locations), design, height, appearance, safety, radio-frequency, and other interference issues as may be lawfully imposed by the city where necessary or appropriate to protect the public, and to conform to policies and interests of the public as may be set forth in special district plans, historic areas, or other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the director of the department of public works and transportation to address changing infrastructure, technology, and uses of the right-of-way and/or city facilities. A wireless facility shall not be located or installed in a manner that results in interference with or impairs the operation of existing utility facilities or city or third-party attachments. Wireless antennas or facilities shall further comply with (1) all applicable requirements for installation of any facilities in the right-of-way as set forth in this article including a right-of-way permit, (2) the requirements of this section, and (3) requirements for installation of wireless antennas and facilities set forth in the Uniform Wireless Communications Infrastructure Deployment Act (§§ 67.5090 et seq. RSMo.), Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (§§ 67.5110 et seq. RSMo.), applicable zoning, building, and other regulations and approvals, specifically including Chapter 31.

b. The applicability of any ordinance, code provision, or other regulations that affect the location of facilities in the right-of-way;
c. The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way, including whether the issuance of a right-of-way permit for the particular dates and/or times requested would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival or any other event.
(5) The area is environmentally sensitive as defined by law or is a historic district as defined by law; or
(6) Any other reason in the public interest permissible under applicable law as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the public welfare and reasonably manage the right-of-way consistent with the purposes of this article.

(a) The public works and transportation director may order a right-of-way user, at the right-of-way user’s own cost, to permanently or temporarily remove, relocate, protect, support or disconnect its facilities, in the right-of-way for the following reasons:
(1) To prevent interference with a public improvement undertaken by the city;

Unless otherwise provided in the written order from the director of public works and transportation, such relocation shall be completed within 30 days of the first written request by the city to relocate the facilities. Failure to relocate facilities at the cost of the right-of-way user within such 30 days or other time period reasonably specified in writing shall constitute a violation of this article subject to the violations provisions herein and shall further constitute basis for denial or revocation of any other use of the right-of-way until remedied.
(d) In the event of an emergency or where construction equipment or facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, the city may, to the extent allowed by law, permanently or temporarily removed, relocated, protected, supported or disconnected such construction equipment or the pertinent parts of such facilities without charge to the city for such action or for restoration or repair. The city shall attempt to notify the person having facilities in the right-of-way prior to taking such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent same. Thereafter, the city shall notify the person having facilities in the right-of-way as soon as practicable.
(e) Any damages suffered by the city, its agents or its contractors to the extent caused by the right-of-way user's failure to timely or properly permanently or temporarily remove, relocate, protect, support or disconnect such facilities, shall be borne by the right-of-way user. Where the right-of-way user shall fail to relocate facilities as required by the city, the city may, but shall not be required to, upon notice to the right-of-way user remove the obstructing facilities with or without further delay and the right-of-way user shall bear all responsibility and liability for the consequences therefrom, and the city shall bear no responsibility to the right-of-way user or others for damage resulting from such removal.

Screening requirements: Each accessory use and structure listed in Table A (pp. 101-103) associated with new permitted and special permit uses shall be totally screened by a 100% opaque structure, including fences and walls, to a minimum six foot height such that the use or activity is not visible from adjacent uses or streets. The opaque structure shall be located as near as possible to the use or activity without interfering with the functional requirements of the use or activity.
f. Preexisting uses.
1. Existing principal uses or structures in the business park zoning districts with an accessory use or structure listed in Table A (pp. 101-103) shall, in the interest of furthering the public welfare and protecting the public health and safety, be required to comply with the screening requirement set forth in Table A (pp. 101-103) within five years after the effective date of this ordinance; provided however, that if the existing accessory use or structure is so situated that compliance with the screening requirement would necessitate removal or substantial alterations to the accessory use or structure, the required screening shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to accommodate the accessory use or structure without removal or substantial alteration.
2. The owners of existing principal uses or structures as defined above shall submit a screening plan to the director of community services for review and approval. There shall be no fee for city review and processing of the screening plan if submitted within five years after the effective date of this ordinance.
3. In cases where compliance with the screening requirement would present an unreasonable hardship on the property owner or present practical difficulties, the property owner may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance pursuant to Section 31-090 and 31-092 of the St. Joseph zoning ordinance.
(2) Parking Lot Landscaping Design Standards.
a. Purpose and applicability: The purpose of the parking lot screening and landscaping requirements is to provide relief from large, hard paved surfaces associated with parking lots necessary to meet the needs of nonresidential developments and to improve the visual appearance of the business park area.
The parking lot landscaping requirements shall be applicable to all new permitted and special permit uses with open parking lots providing spaces for ten or more automobiles. Two types of parking lot landscaping are required:
1. Screening or buffering between the parking lot and adjoining land uses and adjacent streets; and
2. Trees for shading within parking lots.
b. Parking lot screening.
1. The perimeter area of all on-site, open parking areas shall be screened from the view of adjacent properties and streets to an eventual minimum height of three feet by the use of berms, walls and/or plantings.
2. Parking lot screening shall be designed so as to avoid obstructing visibility from vehicles in the parking lot or on adjacent streets. A clear sight triangle of 25 feet from an intersection shall be established to ensure visibility and safety.
3. The parking lot screening requirement does not apply to internal parking lots which do not

§31-054
(5/1/19)
CD31:51
directly front adjacent properties or streets.
4. One hundred percent of the affected street frontage or property boundary, excluding intersecting driveways, must have the required screening.
5. Structures such as decorative walls or fences may be approved if:
[a] The structure avoids a blank and monotonous appearance by such means as architectural articulation and/or the planting of vines, shrubs or trees; or
[b] The total use of berms and/or plantings is not physically feasible; or
[c] The structures complement the use of berms and/or plantings.
6. The reference elevation for the base of the required screen shall be the surface of the parking area that is to be screened.
7. The following maximum grades shall be conformed to in the parking lot screen area:
[a] Grass sod or seeded berms: 3:1 (three feet horizontal:one foot vertical); and
[b] Planting beds: 2:1
8. Where a parking lot is located adjacent to or comes in direct contact with a side or rear yard setback, the side and rear yard landscape setback/buffer area requirements shall apply and the above parking lot screening requirements shall be waived.
c. Parking lot landscaping.
1. One tree shall be provided for every ten vehicular parking spaces, or increment thereof.
2. The required trees shall be located within the parking lot so as to divide and break up expanses of paving and long rows of parking stalls and to create a canopy effect. In general, a minimum of one tree should be located within 80 feet of any parking stall when measured from the trunk.
3. The required parking lot trees should be located within the "parking lot area" where vehicles park and maneuver and not in designated landscape areas. "Within the parking lot area" means the trees must be located in planting areas bounded on at least two sides by parking lot paving. Only trees in landscape "islands," "dividers" or "fingers" shall count toward meeting the parking lot tree requirement.
4. In cases where the size, location or design of parking lots may not significantly benefit from trees within the parking lot area, the required parking lot trees may be provided adjacent to the parking area.
5. The design and size of the landscape planter (islands, dividers and fingers) shall be sufficient to accommodate the growth of the tree and prevent damage to the tree by vehicles.
d. Parking lot paving and design requirement.
1. All parking lots shall be hard-surfaced (dustless) with concrete, asphalt or similar material, except for parking lots containing 50 or less spaces in Subdistrict "Distribution/Warehousing/Light Manufacturing District B-P(D)", which may be loose gravel. Dirt and loose gravel shall be prohibited except as herein provided.
2. All parking lots shall be striped for definitive automobile spaces in the number, size and design as required by Section 26-450 of the St. Joseph zoning ordinance.
3. All off-street parking facilities shall be used solely for the parking of vehicles in operating condition by patrons, occupants

§31-034
(5/1/19)
CD31:38
or employees of the principal use. No motor vehicle repair work, except emergency service, shall be permitted in association with any required off-street parking.
4. All off-street parking spaces shall be provided with safe and convenient access to a public street.
5. All off-street parking areas shall comply with geometric design standards as established by the director of community services which may include, but which shall not be limited to: angle of parking; direction of parking; width of parking space; depth of parking space; and width of aisles.
6. All lighting fixtures used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be designed to minimize glare.

Sec. 31-036. Planned unit development districts.
(a) Statement of intent. Each of the zoning districts hereinbefore set forth shall have a separate and distinct counterpart known and herein referred to as a planned district. A planned district shall be for the purpose of permitting and regulating the uses permitted in the equivalent district or in the case of a wind energy conversion system planned unit development shall conform to the regulations set forth in Section 31-354 and further provide for and encourage latitude and flexibility in the location of buildings, structures, roads, drives, variations in yards, open spaces, etc., subsequent to approval of the plan by local officials. The result is to allow development of tracts of land to their fullest extent and at the same time observe the general intent and spirit of these regulations. The purpose of this district is to also provide for and encourage the appropriate grouping of buildings to reduce vehicle trips, maximize open space and for the beautification of the district.
In general, the height and bulk of buildings, the amount of open space, the concentration of people and traffic and the parking and loading requirements shall be equal to those in the corresponding district. The uses permitted shall be the same as in the equivalent district.
Variations and departures from normal requirements may, however, be permitted. Each building need not face on a public street and more than one main building may be located on a lot. Buildings may be constructed on platted tracts which are smaller than the minimum lot size requirements where other adjacent permanent open space is provided. Buildings may be grouped in clusters or around courts and may be served by private drives in lieu of public streets. Buildings may be located closer to lot lines than otherwise permitted provided such

(b) Procedure for rezoning property to a planned unit development.
(1) A tract of land may be zoned to a planned unit development by the city as provided in Section 31-071, or upon application by the owner or his/her agent with approval of a conceptual development plan for the tract. A city initiated planned unit development zone need not be accompanied by a conceptual development plan. The applicants, other than the city, for a planned unit development zone change, or a developer intending to build on a tract of land zoned as a planned unit development shall prepare and submit to the commission a conceptual development plan containing the following elements:
a. The boundaries of the tract to be zoned and the area adjacent for a distance of not less than 500 feet.
b. The existing and proposed topography. Contours shall not exceed ten foot intervals and shall be on a plan at a scale of one inch equals 200 feet or larger. The proposed topography shall be clearly delineated on the plan.
c. The proposed location and arrangements of buildings, structures, parking areas, existing and proposed streets, drives and other public ways, public property, drainage, landscaping and other features of the proposed development.
d. Sufficient approximate dimensions to indicate the relationship between buildings, streets, drives and property lines.
e. A draft of conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC & Rs), easements, associations and maintenance agreements as well as specifications for ingress/egress to the property and any other legal requirements which will run with the property.
f. Preliminary elevation and plan draw-ings of proposed buildings which sufficiently depict the architectural theme of the development.
g. Preliminary sign program identifying common materials, sizes, heights and locations to be used on signs within the development. The materials used shall be consistent with the architectural theme of the buildings.
(2) The commission shall hold a public hearing on the conceptual development plan and after such public hearing shall either approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the conceptual development plan. At such time as the conceptual development plan is approved, approved with conditions or disapproved by the commission, the same shall be duly endorsed and forwarded to the council for final action. The procedures for noticing and holding a public hearing for a conceptual development plan shall be the same as specified in Section 31-071 of this code. The conceptual development plan is in addition to, not in substitution of, the required statutory rezoning process.
(3) In reviewing conceptual development plans for a planned unit development district, the commission shall consider the following:
a. Topography; to ensure the site is suitable for development, and buildings are located and arranged in appropriate areas.
b. Parking; to ensure the proposed development contains an adequate amount of parking and is located in
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§31-034
(5/1/19)
CD31:38
an appropriate area. Generally, the parking should conform to the required number of parking appropriate to the development type as contained in Section 31-053. The commission may allow a deviation from these parking requirements should the applicant show an adequate amount of parking exists.
c. Setbacks; to ensure buildings provide for adequate light, air, and privacy protection by providing appropriate proportion between buildings, and adequate separation between buildings and adjoining properties.
d. Architecture; to ensure the architectural theme is compatible and consistent throughout the project and is reasonably compatible with surrounding developments.
e. Landscaping; to ensure the development provides adequate landscaping to provide a pleasant environment, to enhance the building's appearance and to ensure existing significant trees are adequately protected.
f. Site plan; to ensure the location and arrangement of buildings, signs and other structures are appropriate for the site, existing and proposed streets, drives and public ways are arranged appropriately and to ensure site drainage has been adequately addressed.
g. Any other feature or issue associated with the state zoning and planning enabling legislation or the comprehensive plan for the City of St. Joseph for which the commission feels is appropriate and relevant to the development of the site.
(4) Prior to approving a conceptual development plan for the purposes of this section, the commission shall make the following findings:
a. That the commission has reviewed the conceptual development plan with consideration of the issues contained in Subsection (3) of this section; and
b. That the conceptual development plan is in conformance with the comprehensive land use plan and other appropriate sections of the Code of Ordinances; and
c. That the conceptual development plan provides for an organized and unified system of land use intensities which are compatible with the surrounding areas; and
d. That the proposed development adequately protects the health, safety and general welfare of future and existing residents and property owners in and around the development.
(5) Upon final approval of the plan and the zoning or rezoning of the tract as required by law, building permits may be issued and conformance with the plan and all supporting documentation is mandatory. Substantial deviation from the plan shall require resubmittal to the commission and council in the same manner as the original zoning procedure.
(6) The wind energy conversion system planned unit development (WECSP-1) is an intended land use that is in harmony with Section 31-350 and the city’s land use plan. It is not exclusive to one land owner. A group of land owners in any zoning district, except residential and commercial zoning districts, may submit a plan for a group wind energy conversion system (WECS). The plan will be reviewed by staff and when available with assistance from a specialist in the industry. If the submitted WECS meets with sound requirements of no more than 45dba at full capacity at the property line of the parcel boundary containing the WECS and also meets the height requirement or is granted an exception from the board of adjustment, the application for the proposed WECSP-1 shall proceed to the commission.

(a) Purpose. This district is designed to provide for those uses or combinations of uses which may be appropriately developed as a
ZONING
§31-054
(5/1/19)
CD31:51
planned area development. It is intended to be applied only to those areas which by reason of their proximity to other zoning districts, topography, geographic location, historic significance, size, shape or existing development require special consideration in order to be properly integrated into the community and adjacent developed districts, and to further the planned circulation patterns, residential densities, use definition, individual property rights, planned coverage limitations and in furtherance of the preservation of open space, public spaces and the general welfare of the neighborhood and City as required by modern land planning and zoning concepts and techniques.
(b) Use regulations. In a P-district no building, structure, land or premises shall be used; and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered other than in conformance with the plan as adopted by council.
(c) Permitted uses. Any use permitted in any other zoning district may be permitted in a P-district, either alone or in combination with other uses, after it has first been determined that the area to be so zoned requires the special consideration herein mentioned.
(d) Conditionally permitted uses. Any conditionally permitted use listed in any other zoning district may be conditionally permitted in a P-district, either alone or in combination with other uses, after it has first been determined that the area to be so zoned requires the special consideration herein mentioned.
(e) Area requirement. Planned community zoning shall not be applied to an area that contains less than five acres.
(f) Height, area and yard requirements. None, except as may be imposed by the precise plan or as a condition upon the granting of a planned community permit
(g) Signs. All signs shall be in accordance with Article II of this chapter based on the use of the property for which the sign is to be erected and subject to the height limitations of the precise plan, unless otherwise defined in the precise plan.
(h) Permit required. A planned community permit shall be required except as specified in subsection (i) prior to the development of any use within the P-district. Said permit shall set forth with particularity the nature of each use to be permitted, and shall define the location and extent of each such permitted use by reference to a map or maps attached to said permit. The application for such permit may be considered concurrently with, or subsequent to, the consideration of P-districts zoning.
(i) Precise plan. The city may adopt a precise plan to delineate uses, relationships to other areas, intensity of use, circulation, design criteria, procedures for development review and special conditions. A precise plan may authorize issuance of a planned community permit by the commission. The commission shall consider the application for a planned community permit approval at a regularly scheduled public hearing within 45 days from the date of the filing of an approved application packet.

(c) Yard exceptions:
(1) Every part of a required yard or court shall be open from its lowest point to the sky unobstructed except for the ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, chimneys, buttresses, ornamental features and eaves, provided, however, that none of the above projections shall extend into a required yard more than 30 inches, and provided further that canopies or open porches may project a maximum of ten feet into the required front or rear yard; and existing open porches extending into the required yard shall not be enclosed.
(2) Required front yards in all districts shall apply unless 40% or more of the frontage on that side of the street between two intersecting streets is improved with buildings that have observed a front yard having a variation in depth of not more than six feet, in which case no building shall project beyond the average front yard so established, but this regulation shall not be interpreted to require a front yard of more than 50 feet.
(3) On corner lots where the rear yard of the subject lot abuts the side yard of an adjacent lot, the street side yard setback shall not be less than 50% of the front yard required on the lots in the rear of such corner lot. In addition, no accessory building on said corner lot shall project beyond the front yard line of lots in the rear.
Further this regulation shall not be interpreted as to reduce the buildable width of the lot, to less than 28 feet, nor to prohibit the construction of an accessory building where this regulation cannot reasonably be complied with.
(4) An open fire escape may project into a required side yard not more than one-half the width of such yard, but not more than four feet from the building.
(5) Fire escapes, solid floored balconies and enclosed outside stairways may project not more than four feet into a required rear yard.

(8) The front, side and rear yard requirements for dwellings shall be waived where dwellings are erected above or attached behind stores.
(9) In computing the side yard for an addition to an existing building, where such addition would violate the zoning district minimum side yard requirements, the side yard of the existing building shall be used as a minimum distance thereof, provided, written permission, evidenced by the notarized signature, of the adjacent property owners approving this building line is obtained prior to the application of a building permit.
(10) In the event that the usable rear yard area equals, or exceeds, 30 times the lot width, the minimum rear yard setback may be 20 feet.
(11) Gasoline service stations may erect a canopy of at least 15 feet in height above the gasoline pumps within the front yard setback area, provided the minimum setback from the front property line is one foot. This yard exception shall not apply to any service station located along any of the city's designated parkway systems or any street designated as a boulevard as identified in the City's land use plan and within the boulevard system master plan.

Sec. 31-057. Accessory utility uses and facilities; all districts
Every public utility, cable company, video service provider and other users of the city rights-of-way or adjacent easements to provide services shall comply with the supplemental regulations in this section regarding the placement of accessory utility facilities on public or private property. For purposes of this section, “accessory utility facilities” shall mean such facilities, including pedestals, boxes, vaults, cabinets, or other ground-mounted or below-ground facilities that directly serve the property or local area in which the facility is placed, are not primarily for transmission or distribution to other locations, do not materially alter the character of the neighborhood or area, and otherwise are customarily found in such areas. Except where limited by other provisions of city ordinance, accessory utility facilities shall be subject to the following supplementary regulations:
(1) Approval; design; location; application; notice. The design, location, and nature of all accessory utility facilities on private or public property shall require approval of the city, which approval shall be considered in a nondiscriminatory manner, in conformance with this section, and subject to reasonable permit conditions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this section. To that end, prior to any construction, excavation, installation, expansion or other work on any accessory utility facility, the facility owner shall apply to the city and submit detailed plans for the city’s review and approval. Contemporaneous with such application, the facility owner shall provide notice to all private property owners within 185 feet of the location of the proposed construction, excavation or other work. Notice shall include detailed description of the proposed work to be done, the exact location of proposed work and the anticipated time and duration when the proposed work will be undertaken. Notice shall be given at least five business days prior to the commencement of any such work. In considering individual applications or multiple location applications, the city shall review the request to ensure the proposed facilities do not impair public safety, harm property values or significant sight-lines, or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining properties or neighborhood, and taking into consideration reasonable alternatives. Any material changes or extensions to such facilities or the construction of any additional structures shall be subject to the requirements and approvals as set forth herein. Unless otherwise prohibited, utility facilities subject to this subsection may be located in minimum setback areas provided that all other requirements are met. To the extent permitted by Section 67.2707.1(3) RSMo., the time, method, manner or location of facilities to be located in the rights-of-way may be established or con-ditioned by the city to protect the rights-of-way or to ensure public safety. An inspection fee shall be required as may be established by the city to reimburse the city for the costs of review and inspection of accessory utility facilities as may be permitted by applicable law.
(2) General regulations. The following general regulations apply to all accessory utility facilities:
a. All such facilities shall be placed underground, except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) herein or as approved by conditional use permit.
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§31-034
(5/1/19)
CD31:38
b. All such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise.
c. All facilities and utility boxes shall be deemed abandoned after six continuous months of non-use, and shall therefore be removed within 30 days thereafter at the cost of the utility. Land from which abandoned facilities or utility boxes are removed, whether on private or public property, shall be restored within 30 days of removal by the facility owner or have costs of such remedies charged to the facility owner. The facility owner shall restore the land using similar plantings or sod of the same type of grass immediately surrounding the land and shall replace all existing plantings damaged by the removal work with like plantings and shall replace all damaged existing grass areas with sod of the same type of grass as was damaged.
d. Unless otherwise restricted, utility poles for authorized above ground lines or facilities shall be permitted up to 45 feet in height where utilities are not otherwise required to be placed underground; provided that such poles shall be no higher than necessary, maintained so as to avoid leaning from upright position, and without use of guy wires crossing rights-of-way or pedestrian routes except where approved by the city as necessary due to the lack of feasible alternatives.
e. Utility facilities placed in designated historic areas may be subject to additional requirements regarding the placement and appearance of facilities as may be necessary to reasonably avoid or reduce any negative impact of such placement.
f. Any damage to landscaping or vegetation on private or public property during installation or maintenance of facilities shall be remedied by the facility owner within 30 days of such damage.
g. No facilities may be located so as to interfere, or be likely to interfere, with any public facilities or use of public property.
h. All such facilities proposed to be located within a Historic district shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article III of this Chapter 31 of the city code.
i. All utility facilities not authorized by this subsection or specifically addressed elsewhere in this Code shall be authorized only by a conditional use permit pursuant to Article I of this Chapter 31 of the city code.
(3) Residential districts. In residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto, accessory utility facilities less than three and one-half feet in height and covering less than eight square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the city. Except as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger utility facility shall be installed underground or authorized to be installed above ground only by conditional use permit. All above ground facilities, where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical. If locating these facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public right-of-way unless otherwise approved by the city upon a determination that all other alternatives are not feasible.
(4) Non-residential districts. In non-residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto, accessory utility facilities with a height of less than five feet and covering less than 16 square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the city. Except as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger utility facility shall be installed underground or authorized to be

installed above ground only by conditional use permit. All above ground facilities, where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical. If locating these facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public rights-of-way unless otherwise approved by the city upon a determination that all other alternatives are not feasible.
(5) Landscape screening. A sight-proof landscape screen shall be provided for all authorized above ground facilities taller than three feet in height or covering in excess of four square feet in size. Such screen shall be required to sufficiently conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be submitted by the utility and approved by the city prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening. The utility shall be responsible for the installation, repair, or replacement of screening materials. Alternative screening or concealment may be approved by the city to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements. Facilities located in rear yards may be exempted from screening where located so as not to be visible from any public property and more than two residential dwelling units. Any required screening shall be completed within the timeframe set forth in the permit required under this section, or not less than 30 days from issuance of the permit, if not otherwise stated.
(6) Compliance with other laws. All accessory utility facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as part of the city code, including but not limited to building codes, zoning requirements and rights-of-way management regulations in addition to the supplementary regulations herein. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any circumstance or entity in which application under such circumstances is preempted or otherwise precluded by superseding law.

(a) Shipping containers, up to three, are permitted on building sites in residential, commercial or manufacturing zoning districts. If a contractor, builder, owner or other individual associated with the construction at any given property within a residential, commercial, or manufacturing zoning district has a need for more than three shipping containers at one time for building materials they must request a permit for additional storage containers from the planning and community development director. Storage containers on the above-mentioned construction sites will be allowed 15 days prior to the commencement of construction and must be removed within 15 days after the completion of construction on the property.
(b) Shipping containers may be used as storage units on property that is zoned M-1 or M-2 (light manufacturing and heavy manufacturing) and the owner of the property shall inform the city if hazardous waste or chemicals are stored in these shipping containers.
(c) Shipping containers cannot be used on land that is zoned C-0, C-1, C-2 and C-3 commercial districts. Businesses located in a C-3 zoning district can request a conditional use permit (CUP) for the use of shipping containers for storage. No business will be allowed more than 10 shipping containers on their property.
(d) Shipping containers are not allowed in a residential zoning district or property that is residential in character for purposes of storage. The use of shipping containers for the construction of a residential dwelling unit in any residential zoning district or property that is residential in character may be allowed by the granting of a variance or exception through the board of zoning adjustment.

Sec. 31-070. Conditional Use Permits.
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§31-034
(5/1/19)
CD31:38
(a) Applicability. Conditional uses, as listed in each zoning district have been determined to have a unique, special or potentially adverse impact upon the use or enjoyment of neighboring properties and, therefore, require site plan review by the commission and the city council to assure that the proposed use and site plan meet the standards established herein and the purpose and intent of each of the zoning districts. Said conditional use permits are granted solely for the benefit of the persons specified therein or their immediate family and automatically cease when said person sublets, vacates or sells the land specified therein or discontinues the conditional use granted herein.
(b) Site and landscape plan required. Each application for conditional use permit approval shall be accompanied by a site and landscape plan (collectively, the "site plan") including the following data and information:
(1) The location, dimension, material and configuration of all buildings, structures and other improvements;
(2) The location and extent of usable open space;
(3) The location, access and other dimensions of proposed off-street parking and loading facilities and the number and configuration of spaces to be provided;
(4) The location, dimensions and materials of sidewalks, driveways and other impervious surfaces;
(5) The location and intensity of illumination of any illuminated areas;
(6) The proposed use of open space;
(7) A landscaping plan, which shall include existing and proposed landscaping on both the subject property and adjacent public areas and including an installation schedule;
(8) The location of all utilities, including electric lines, storm drainage, sanitary sewers and water service;
(9) The location and extent of required setbacks and yards;
(10) The elevation of all buildings and structures to depict height;
(11) The lot size in square feet and the dimensions thereof;
(12) Any areas proposed for outdoor storage, refuse collection, exterior mechanical equipment, exterior communication devices and utility apparatus;
(13) The dimensions, location and landscaping of required landscape/buffer setbacks and screening; and
(14) The land uses surrounding the lot(s) for which site plan approval is being sought.
(15) The zoning on the lots and parcels surrounding the lot(s) for which site plan approval is being sought.
(16) Such additional information as the city planner may deem pertinent and essential to the application.
(c) Request for conditional use permit approval. A request for conditional use permit approval shall be made by the applicant in writing, on forms provided by the city, shall be accompanied by the site plan, and shall be filed with the city planner. Each request shall be accompanied by payment of the non-refundable fee as set out in Subsection 31-075(2). After the completed application, site plan, non-refundable filing fee and all supporting documentation have been submitted, the city planner shall review the application and site plan for purposes of determining:
(1) Whether the proposed use is an allowed conditional use in the applicable zoning district; and
(2) Whether the application for conditional use permit approval and the site plan are complete and in conformance with the requirements as set forth herein.
The city planner shall note the date the application was filed and the date the filing fee was paid and make a permanent record thereof.
If the proposed use is not an allowed conditional use in the applicable zoning district, or if the application or site plan is determined to
ZONING
§31-054
(5/1/19)
CD31:51
be incomplete, the city planner shall notify the applicant in writing within ten working days of the date of filing. Thereafter, the applicant may resubmit the application and site plan to the city planner for review. If it is again rejected by the city planner, the applicant may appeal pursuant to Subsection (f) hereof.
If the proposed use is an allowed conditional use in the applicable zoning district and the application and site plan are determined to be complete, the city planner shall concurrently forward the application and site plan to the commission.
Failure of the city planner to forward the application to the commission as set forth above shall constitute a determination that the proposed use is not permitted in the applicable zoning district or that the application or site plan is incomplete. The application and site plan shall not be "deemed approved" by a failure to forward the application to the planning commission.
(d) Review by commission. The commission shall consider the application for conditional use permit approval and the site plan at a regularly-scheduled or a special commission public hearing within 45 days from the date of filing of the application and site plan. Notice of such application shall be given by publication in an official newspaper or a paper of general circulation in the city indicating the time and place of the commission public hearing on said application, at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. Additionally, the commission shall make a special effort to inform by certified mail the owners of all property within 185 feet of the property for which the conditional use permit application has been filed. At the public hearing, parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.
(e) Procedure for commission recommendation to city council. After the close of the public hearing, the commission shall consider the application for conditional use permit approval, the site plan, relevant supporting data and documentation submitted by the applicant and all relevant testimony and evidence submitted at the public hearing, and shall determine whether the use as proposed conforms to the requirements of this article by considering the factors set forth in Subsection (f) hereof. The commission shall make its recommendation to the city council not more than 20 days after the close of the public hearing. If a recommendation is not made within the 20 day period, the commission shall be deemed to have recommended denial.
If such proposed use conforms to the general standards and specific requirements of this article, the commission shall recommend approval of the application for conditional use permit and the site plan. If such proposed use does not conform with one or more of the general standards and specific requirements of this article, the commission shall recommend denial of the application for conditional use permit approval and the site plan or recommend approval of the application of conditional use permit approval and the site plan with conditions, pursuant to Subsection (g) hereof, to ameliorate the lack of conformance with the general standard or specific requirement. If the commission recommends denial of the application for conditional use permit approval and the site plan, the applicant shall be given 75 days to resubmit the application and site plan with modifications. Site plan approval by the city council is required in order to obtain a conditional use permit from the director of planning and community development and to apply for and receive a building permit from the chief building official.
(f) Consideration of factors. The commission shall consider the following factors based on the application for conditional use permit approval and the site plan for the proposed conditional use:
(1) Whether the proposed conditional use permit is in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives and standards of the adopted city land use plan;
(2) Whether the proposed conditional use permit is detrimental to existing adjacent uses or to uses permitted generally in the zoning district in which the proposed conditional use is to be located;
(3) Whether the proposed conditional use will generate volumes and/or types of vehicular traffic that will be hazardous to or conflict with the existing or anticipated traffic in the surrounding area;
(4) Whether the proposed conditional use meets the height, area and design standards established in the zoning district; and
ST. JOSEPH CODE
§31-034
(5/1/19)
CD31:38
(5) Whether the site plan for the proposed conditional use illustrates a project design which will be compatible with existing and future permitted uses in the surrounding area.
(g) Imposition of conditions. Based on the commission's consideration of the factors listed in Subsection (f) hereof, the applicant or the commission may recommend the attachment of specific conditions to the application for a conditional use permit approval and/or to the site plan to ameliorate the adverse impact of the proposed conditional use permit on the zoning district or on adjacent uses. Such conditions may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
(1) A time limit on the effective period of the conditional use permit;
(2) Mitigation of adverse impacts by additional on-site buffer, landscaping, setback or open space requirements;
(3) Mitigation of adverse impacts by restrictions on density, floor area ratio, height or percentage of lot coverage;
(4) Mitigation of adverse impacts by the provision of off-site public facilities or improvements;
(5) Limitations on hours of operation of the conditional use;
(6) Limitations on noise, odor, vibrations, glare or dust emanating from the conditional use;
(7) Limitations on the number of employees of the conditional use;
(8) Limitations on the materials stored or used on the site;
(9) Limitations on the height of structures; and
(10) Requirements for a larger minimum lot area.
(h) City council action on site plan and conditional use permit. No application for site plan and conditional use permit approval shall be granted without action by the city council within 90 days of receipt of the site plan, application for conditional use permit approval and the recommendation of the commission and first reading by the city clerk at a regular meeting of the city council. The failure of the city council to act within 90 days shall be deemed to constitute denial of the site plan and application for conditional use permit approval.
(i) Appeals. Any action by the city council on an application for conditional use permit approval and for site plan approval may be appealable to the circuit court.
(j) Time limit on site plan and conditional use permit approval. Approval of a site plan and issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to this article shall become null and void unless used within one year from the date of council ap-proval unless a shorter time has been prescribed by the conditions of the permit. A permit shall be deemed "used" when actual substantial and continuous activity has taken place upon the land pursuant to the permit or in the event of the erection of a structure(s) when sufficient building activity has occurred and continues to occur in a diligent manner.
(k) Issuance of building, occupancy or use permits. No building, occupancy or use permit shall be issued with respect to a conditional use permit until the site plan has been approved, all applicable conditions imposed through the site plan have been met and a conditional use permit has been issued by the director of planning and community development; provided, however, that when weather or other restrictions preclude the provision of required landscaping or other improvement requirements, the city may allow the issuance of the requested building, occupancy or use permit upon submission by the applicant of a bond or other surety approved by the city attorney and in an amount equal to not less than one and one-half times the estimated cost of said improvements as approved by the department of planning and community development. The bond or surety shall remain in effect until all required improvements have been completed.
(l) Revocation of permits.
(1) Any building, occupancy or use permits issued pursuant to an approved site plan and conditional use permit or in conjunction therewith may be revoked by the city for failure to comply with the conditions of approval or for intentionally
ZONING
§31-054
(5/1/19)
CD31:51
providing false or misleading information regarding any part of the conditional use permit or site plan. To revoke the conditional use permit and site plan, the city planner shall set a date for a public hearing before the city council and notice a public hearing in accordance with subsection (d) herein. Following such hearing, the city council shall make findings of whether the conditions of the permit have not been or are not complied with and render a decision to revoke or modify the permit.
(2) In any case where, in the judgment of the city planner, substantial evidence indicates that the use conducted pursuant to a conditional use permit is being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, the city planner shall set a date for the public hearing before the city council and notice the public hearing in accordance with subsection (d) herein. Following such hearing, the city council shall make findings of whether the use has been conducted in a manner detrimental with the public health, safety or welfare, and render a decision whether or not to revoke or modify the conditional use permit and site plan.
(m) Extensions. The city council may, without public hearing, extend such time for a maximum of one additional year only, upon application filed with the city planner before the expiration of the one year limit, or the expiration of such limit as may be specified by the conditions of the conditional use permit.
(n) Duration. A conditional use permit shall be granted solely for the benefit of the person(s) specified therein or their immediate family and automatically ceases when said person(s) sublets, vacates or sells the land specified therein or discontinues the conditional use granted herein. If the use for which the conditional use permit was granted and utilized has ceased or has been suspended for one year or more, it becomes null and void and of no effect.
(o) Amendments to an approved site plan or conditional use permit. Should the city planner find substantial or significant deviation from the approved site plan or conditional use permit, the city planner shall notify the applicant of such and direct the applicant to modify or apply for an amendment to the conditional use permit. The procedure for amendment of a site plan already approved or for a request for a change of conditions attached to the issuance of a conditional use permit shall be the same as for a new application for site plan approval or conditional use permit issuance.
(p) Grandfather clause. No applications for a conditional use permit shall be necessary for the existing uses which were lawful conforming uses and which were rendered conditionally permitted uses by reason of change to this chapter or rezoning, or for uses which have existing valid special use permits as approved prior to the change in this chapter, provided that any expansion in the building site area of such use shall be subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit in accordance with this section. However, a previously approved special use permit shall be subject to the time limits, revocation procedures, extension and duration provisions and amendment provisions as contained in this section.

Sec. 31-091. Appeals.
(a) When appeals may be taken. Appeals to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality affected by any decision of the chief building official or city planner. Such appeal shall be taken within five days from the date of the decision by the chief building official, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officers from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(b) Extent of the Board's appeal powers. In exercising its powers, the board may, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the chief building official, or to decide in favor of the applicant, or to effect any variation to the zoning code. A concurring vote of three members of the board is necessary to affirm wholly the order, requirement or determination of the chief building official.
(c) Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the actions appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause immediate peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
(d) Decisions on appeals. The board shall render decisions only on appeals from an action of the chief building official or city planner. The board shall take action only when it has determined that a permit has been incorrectly issued or denied, or when it has determined that the ordinance has been incorrectly interpreted, or when the appellant proves that the standards for a variance contained in Section 31-092(b) as applied to a specific lot or tract of land or building have been met. In case the standards for granting variances have been met, the board may issue a variance signed by the chairman, setting out any conditions to be met. A copy of the variance shall be sent to the chief building official who shall issue a building permit setting out the terms of the variance. In no case shall the board decide an appeal from an action of the city council or commission, nor shall it render decisions or rulings which have the effect of repealing or amending this ordinance. In all cases, the spirit and intent of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.

(3) Permitting the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot in a single ownership at the time of the passage of this ordinance.

(f) Conditions and restrictions. The board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in this ordinance to reduce, minimize, or mitigate the effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and better to carry out the general intent of the ordinance. Failure to comply with any such conditions and restrictions shall constitute a violation of this ordinance.
(g) Notice of decision. After the hearing and making a decision, the board shall file its written decision on the requested variance, supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law and list of sections varied with respect to the standards in Subsection 31-092(a), with the chief building official.

(b) Permit process. No building permit, whether to erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, excavate for, convert or demolish any building, structure or utility, shall be issued with respect to any real property located within the downtown precise plan area except in accordance with the terms and provisions of the certificate of appropriateness as approved by the downtown review board if property is located in the downtown precise plan area; however, a building permit may be issued with respect to such real property for the accomplishment of any work thereon which will change neither the exterior appearance nor the exterior architectural features of the improvements thereof, or which is considered necessary as a part of the ordinary maintenance of the property.

Such definitions and criteria may identify the scale or work, the skill and equipment needed, the timeliness of repairs, and the typical effect of specific activities on historic material as factors for determining whether an activity constitutes ordinary maintenance or requires a certificate of appropriateness. The following criteria shall be utilized to make a determination:
(1) Except as otherwise provided herein, no land surface within any real property designated within the downtown precise plan area shall be changed, and no improvements thereon shall be erected, removed, restored, demolished or altered, nor shall any addition be made thereto, in such a manner or of such a character as to change the appearance or the exterior architectural features thereof, if such change would be visible from any public street, park or other public place, as determined by the city planner, without prior approval evidenced by a certificate of appropriateness reciting in detail the approved changes.
(2) Such prohibited changes in appearance or exterior architectural features shall include but not be limited to the erection of business, professional and other signs in, on or about the downtown precise plan area, and no certificates of appropriateness shall permit the erection of any such sign, unless the size, texture, style and materials thereof are compatible with the general characteristics of the neighborhood and otherwise comply with zoning and building regulations.
(3) Any person desiring to erect, remove, restore, demolish, alter or in any way change the exterior appearance or the exterior architectural features of improvements on any real property located within the downtown precise plan area shall apply for a building permit from the chief building official, and upon receipt of such a request the chief building official shall notify the applicant of the duty to submit application to the downtown review board for property located within the downtown precise plan area for a certificate of appropriateness. Upon receipt of an application for certificate of appropriateness, the downtown review board shall schedule a public hearing and give at least seven days public notice thereof by publication in an official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation within the city. A copy of the agenda item shall be sent by mail or electronic mail to the applicant at

the address applicant so provides on the application.
(c) Improvements not requiring certificates of appropriateness. The following shall be specifically exempted from the need for a certificate of appropriateness:
(1) Improvements which constitute patios or similar areas that will be used for outdoor seating and/or dining where the construction or use thereof will not cause the removal of landscaping and/or greenspace existing on, or which was planted/created after October 12, 2015; or
(2) The installation of fences that consist of painted rod iron/metal that will enclose those areas described in Subsection (c)(1); or
(3) Minor changes that have been deemed as NOT substantial by the city planner to a project that has been granted a certificate of appropriateness.
(d) Approval of certificates of appropriateness. All interested parties shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard before the downtown review board which shall determine, either:
(1) The changes proposed are not visible from any public street, park or other public place as determined by the city planner; or
(2) The changes set forth in the application are not detrimental to the architectural, cultural, historic or contextual character of other improvements of the real property located within the downtown precise plan area. The downtown review board shall forthwith issue a certificate of appropriateness, stating in writing findings of fact and conclusions of law and detailing the work approved. Such certificate shall then be presented to the department of planning and community development who shall check the application for conformity with all applicable zoning codes; and to the building regulations division who shall check the application for compliance with building codes. The time limitations of the building codes shall control from this time forward. In the event that no building permit is necessary for the improvements controlled by the certificate of appropriateness, the certificate shall be valid for a term of one year from its date of issuance. The applicant must complete the work approved in the certificate of appropriateness within one year of:
a. The date the certificate of appropriateness is issued; or,
b. In the event a building permit is required, from the date of issuance of the building permit.
Otherwise, the certificate shall expire and a new application shall be filed with the planning and community development department.
(e) Denial of certificates of appropriateness. If, after a public hearing, the downtown review board determines that proposed changes are visible from any public street, park or other public place; and that such changes are detrimental to the architectural, cultural, historic or contextual character of the real property located within the downtown precise plan, the downtown review board shall enter an order denying a certificate of appropriateness, along with supporting written findings and at the same time shall mail a copy of the decision to the applicant. The downtown review board shall forward a copy of such order to the chief building official. The chief building official shall thereafter refuse to issue a building or demolition permit for which a certificate of appropriateness was denied. The downtown review board may grant a rehearing of an application for a certificate of appropriateness which it has decided, if an application seeking rehearing includes a concise statement of the new evidence to be considered by the board; and the application for rehearing is made to the downtown review board within ten working days from the date upon which the applicant was notified of the downtown review board’s original action of denial. Only one application for rehearing may be made in any case. Any rehearing granted shall proceed upon public notice and be a full and fair hearing.

Sec. 31-178. Procedure for designation of local historic landmarks and local historic districts.
(a) Intent. It is intended that a local historic landmark or local historic district will provide additional safeguards to ensure that landmarks or districts with unique historic characteristics are protected and preserved for future generations. It is also intended that the local historic landmark or local historic district regulations, although independent, supplement applicable zoning district regulations and city building codes. Accordingly, the regulations in this article shall not replace those required by other sections of this code.
(b) Hearing.
(1) Upon receipt of an application meeting the requirements of Subsections 31-177(a) and (b) of this article proposing a local historic landmark or local historic district designation, amendment or rescission, the landmark commission at its next regular meeting shall set a public hearing on such application to be held within 30 days of such setting. Notice of such public hearing shall be given by publication in an official newspaper or a paper of general circulation in the city identifying the property that is the subject of the application and indicating the time and place of the public hearing at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing.
(2) At least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, a copy of the notice of the public hearing shall also be mailed by certified mail to all property owners of record shown on the Buchanan County tax rolls for the preceding calendar year of all lots, tracts or parcels of land lying within the local historic landmark or local historic district designation boundary affected by the application.
(3) At the public hearing, all interested persons shall have the opportunity to be heard. The landmark commission may solicit expert testimony regarding the historic and architectural importance of the building, structure, site, monument, area or other landmark under consideration.
(4) The landmark commission may call witnesses to present testimony or documentary evidence.
(5) All interested persons may appear in person or by attorney to present evidence.
(6) The landmark commission shall make a recommendation that the application shall be approved or denied at the close of the public hearing by a vote. Motions for recommendation of approval of application(s) shall reference Subsection 31-177(c) of this article “Criteria for selection of local historic landmarks and local historic districts”. A simple majority vote by a quorum of the landmark commission shall be required to constitute an affirmative recommendation on any application presented to the landmark commission. The landmark commission may continue the public hearing to the next regularly scheduled meeting without additional public notice provided that the date, time and place of
ZONING

the continued meeting shall be announced prior to adjournment and shall be set forth in the minutes.
(c) Protests. In the event a written protest against an application for a local historic landmark or local historic district designation, amendment or rescission is presented to the landmark commission not later than the date of the public hearing thereon, signed and acknowledged (notarized) by the owners of record of:
a. In the case of a newly proposed local historic district, any improved parcel located within the proposed local historic district;
b. In the case of a proposed expansion of an existing local historic district, any improved parcel located within the proposed expansion area; or
c. In the case of a proposed removal of property from a local historic district, any improved parcel adjoining the property to be removed, such written protest shall be included in the recommendation made by the landmark commission.
(d) Recommendation by landmark commission. After consideration and vote by the landmark commission, a written recommendation shall be forwarded to the city council. Any protest, or lack thereof, shall be noted as part of the landmark commission’s recommendation. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the landmark commission, the city council shall consider passage of a general ordinance which shall specifically describe the local historic landmark or the local historic district to be designated or to be amended, including a legal description by subdivision, lot and block.
(e) Notice by city council. Before passage of any ordinance proposing a local historic landmark or local historic district designation, amendment or rescission, the city council shall hold a public hearing on such ordinance and shall give a minimum of 15 days prior notice by publication in an official newspaper or a paper of general circulation in the city. All interested persons may appear and be heard on the matter.
(f) Historic designation. The designation of a local historic landmark or local historic district shall be effective until such time as said designation is revoked. Revocation of an local historic landmark designation shall be considered by the landmark commission and city council at the request of an “owner” (as that term is defined herein). Revocation or a change of boundary of a local historic district shall be considered as follows:
(1) Upon presentment to the landmark commission, of notarized statement of at least 20 owners of property located in the local historic district requesting revocation of the district designation or of a notarized statement of the affected owner requesting removal of property from the local historical district, the landmark commission shall proceed as set out in Subsections 31-178(b), (c), (d) and (e) of the code of city ordinances. For purposes of this section, “owner” shall mean a record owner of real estate within the concerned local historic district; each such owner shall be counted as one owner and in no case shall any owner be counted more than once regardless of the number of property owned by him/her.
(2) Upon the city council's receipt of the recommendation of the landmark commission concerning revocation of a local historic landmark designation or removal of real property from a local historic district, and before passage of any ordinance, the city council shall hold a public hearing on such ordinance and shall give a minimum of 15 days prior notice by publication in an official newspaper or a paper of general circulation in the city. Adoption of such ordinance shall be by majority vote of the full city council.
(3) Upon passage of an ordinance designating a particular site as a local historic landmark or a local historic district, notice shall be sent to the chief building official and to the city clerk who shall cause a copy thereof to be recorded at the Buchanan County Recorder's Office. The applicant shall pay the fees for recordation.
(g) Temporary stay of demolition. Except as otherwise provided by Subsection 31-182(b), once the landmark commission has recommended designation of a property as a local historic

landmark or an area as a local historic district, during the pendency of a final decision thereon by the city council, the city shall issue no permit for demolition, in whole or in part, of any building, site or structure located on the property of the proposed local historic landmark or proposed local historic district until the city council takes final action on the designation; such restriction shall not extend beyond 90 days from the date of city council receipt of such recommendation.

(b) Permit process. No building permit, whether to erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, excavate for, convert or demolish any building, structure or utility, shall be issued with respect to any real property within a local historic district or an historic landmark, except in accordance with the terms and provisions of the certificate of appropriateness as approved by the landmark commission, however, a building permit may be issued with respect to such real property for the accomplishment of any work thereon which will change neither the exterior appearance nor the exterior architectural features of the improvements thereof, or which is considered necessary as a part of the ordinary maintenance of the property. The landmark commission shall identify definitions and specific criteria to be used in determining if work constitutes ordinary maintenance with the landmark commission’s rules of procedure and/or design guidelines.
(1) Except as otherwise provided herein, no land surface within any real property designated as a local historic landmark or as a local historic district shall be changed, and no improvements thereon shall be erected, removed, restored, demolished or altered, nor shall any addition be made thereto, in such a manner or of such a character as to change the appearance or the exterior architectural features thereof, if such change would be visible from any public street, park or other public place, as determined by the historic preservation planner, without prior approval evidenced by a certificate of appropriateness reciting in detail the approved changes.
(2) Any person desiring to erect, remove, restore, demolish, alter or in any way change the exterior appearance or the exterior architectural features of improvements on any real property designated a local historic landmark or located within a local historic district, or desiring to change the land surface thereof shall apply for a building permit from the chief building official, and upon receipt of such a request the chief building official shall notify the applicant of the duty to submit application to the landmark commission for a certificate of appropriateness.

(1) The changes proposed are not visible from any public street, park or other public place as determined by the historic preservation planner; or
(2) That the changes set forth in the application are not detrimental to the architectural, cultural, historic or contextual character of other improvements of the real property designated as a local historic landmark or local historic district, the landmark commission shall forthwith issue a certificate of appropriateness, stating in writing findings of fact and conclusions

(d) Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the petitioner has satisfactorily met the requirements of subsection (c), the city council shall conclude that such an exception will serve to advance the preservation or restoration of a significant historical structure in the city, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:
(1) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project that would otherwise not be available;
(2) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(3) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;
(4) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decision-making process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(5) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (a) of this section;
(6) Whether undue hardship will result either to the petitioner or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and
(7) Any other relevant considerations.

ARTICLE IV. FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
Sec. 31-200. Statutory authorization.
Section 89.020 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri delegates the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the city.
(G.O. 1855, 11-13-01)
Sec. 31-201. Findings of fact.
(a) Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of St. Joseph, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b) General causes of flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
(1) The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
(2) By the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(c) Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelates steps as follows:
(1) Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent change of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator’s FIS and illustrative materials dated September 19, 1984, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
(2) Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
(3) Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point.
(4) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.
(5) Delineation of flood fringe, i.e. that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.

Sec. 31-202. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 31-201; to establish or maintain the community’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to

meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this article to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require uses vulnerable of floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and;
(3) Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.
(Code 1969, Sec. 26-601; [Sec. 31-601] G.O. 13973, 4-22-96; G.O. 1855, 11-13-01)
Sec. 31-203. Lands to which article applies.
This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of St. Joseph, Missouri, identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones, AE, AO and AH Zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) dated September 19, 1984, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and as specifically noted in Sections 31-213 through 31-218.

Sec. 31-215. Manufactured homes.
(a) All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AE and AH zones, on the community’s FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top frame ties to ground anchors.
(b) Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A zones AE and AH zones, on the community's FIRM, on sites:
(1) Outside of manufactured home park or subdivision;
(2) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
(3) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
(4) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood,

Sec. 31-216. Areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 31-203 are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exit and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) Within AO Zones
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
b. All new construction and substantial improvements of commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
c. Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(2) Within AH Zones.
a. The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided shall be required as set forth in Section 31-214.
b. Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

Sec. 31-217. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 31-203 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
(2) The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3) If Subsection (2) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 31-213.

Sec. 31-219. Establishment of variance procedures.
(a) The board of zoning adjustment, as established by Section 89.110 RSMo, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this article.
(b) Responsibility of appeal board. Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the floodplain management regulations is denied by the floodplain administrator, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the board of zoning adjustment as defined in Section 31-219. The board of zoning adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c) Further appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the circuit court of the County of Buchanan, Missouri, within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board.

Sec. 31-221. Conditions for approving floodplain management variances or exceptions.
(a) Generally, variances or exceptions may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items listed in subsections (b) through (f) below, have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance, but not exception, increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure’s continued historic designation.
(c) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(f) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.
(g) Exceptions for signs and accessory structures shall be issued as per Section 31-093.
(Code 1969, Sec. 26-630; [Sec. 31-630] G.O. 1393, 4-22-96 (Sec. 31-205(d)(3)); G.O. 1855, 11-13-01)
Sec. 31-222. Conditions for approving exceptions for accessory structures.
Any exception granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building’s unique circumstances. Exceptions granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Section 31-220 and 31-221 of this article.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any exception issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-proofed:
(1) Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in zone A only as identified on the community’s FIRM.

(2) For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with Section 31-213(d)(2) of this article.
(3) The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Section 31-213(d)(1) of this article. All of the building’s structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
(4) Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with Section 31-213(d)(4) of this article.
(5) The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with Section 31-214(a)(3) of this article.
(6) The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provisions of Section 31-216(2) of this article. No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood.

ARTICLE V. TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND FACILITIES
Sec. 31-300. Purpose.
(a) Statement of purpose. The general purpose of this Article V (“Article”) is to regulate the placement, construction and modification of wireless communications facilities to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City of St. Joseph. Specifically, this article is intended to:
1. Provide for the appropriate location and development of wireless communications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of St. Joseph; and
2. Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless communications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques that provide predictability for nearby property owners and others that future uses will not materially alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input from interested parties; and
3. Ensure that any new wireless communications facilities are compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community and surrounding land uses to the extent possible; and
4. Ensure that regulation of wireless communications facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service and promotes the provision and availability of communication services within the city, and is no more burdensome than regulations applied to other types of infrastructure deployments.
(b) Applicability; preemption. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this article shall be applicable to all wireless communications facilities existing or installed, built or modified after the effective date of this article to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided that any wireless communications facilities existing prior to the effective date of this article and not in full compliance with the requirements of this article shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use. No provision of this Article shall apply to any circumstance in which such application shall be unlawful under superseding federal or state law and furthermore, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this article is now or in the future superseded or preempted by state or federal law or found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be automatically interpreted and applied as required by law.
