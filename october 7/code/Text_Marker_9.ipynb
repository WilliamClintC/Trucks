index city of auburn zoning ordinance an ordinance in pursuance of the authority granted by title 11 chapter 52 articles 1 through 4 inclusive of the 1975 code of alabama to provide the establishment of districts within the corporate limits of the city of auburn alabama  to regulate within such districts the height number of stories and size of buildings and other structures the percentage of lot that may be occupied the size of yards and other open spaces the density of population and the use of buildings structures and land  to repeal all existing zoning ordinances and to provide methods of administration of this ordinance and penalties for the violation thereof. the public welfare requiring it be it ordained by the city council of the city of auburn as follows: article i. title purpose and jurisdiction. section 100. title. this ordinance shall be known as and may be referred to as the  auburn zoning ordinance  and includes maps of the city that depict the boundaries of zoning districts. section 101. legislative intent. in enacting the zoning ordinance special notice has been taken of the fact that the goals of citizens and landowners of auburn often conflict or compete. in the light of this situation the first consideration has been to devise technical solutions which minimize or eliminate conflicts. this ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate both competing interests. this has inevitably and properly led to some form of compromise. in arriving at these compromises every possible consideration has been given to the public interest individual property rights and externalities. while compromise implies mutual concessions or losses it also implies   and this ordinance has been designed to provide   mutual gains and benefits. it is the goal of this ordinance that both the burdens and the benefits it implies are rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property owners of auburn. every effort has been made to make uses a matter of right subject to performance criteria capable of nondiscretionary objective administrative evaluations thus reducing the number of times that rezoning decisions need be made. this greatly increases the potential uses or choices available to individual property owners. the rezoning decisions that conventional zoning ordinances frequently necessitate appear to reduce the certainty of protection to neighbors and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to auburn. this ordinance contains performance criteria intended to insure that neighbors are protected from adverse impacts. the ordinance also contains performance criteria to protect the community s general welfare. zoning districts are few in number and each has a clearly different purpose. distinctions among zoning districts are based upon the city s comprehensive plan. the districts are sized to be adequate to handle auburn s long-term needs and must be regularly updated as time passes. where performance criteria severely limit the use of properties the ordinance has gone to considerable extremes to provide the landowners with a range of choices flexibility and options for development. section 102. purpose. the purpose of this ordinance is the promotion of the health safety and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of auburn by: i-1 102.01. giving effect to the policies and proposals set forth in the city s comprehensive plan. 102.02. providing methods to preserve and maintain a healthful environment for the benefit of present and future generations by providing standards to control the amount of open space and impervious surfaces within a development  to control the intensity of development in areas of sensitive natural resources or natural features in order to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts. 102.03. controlling and regulating the growth of auburn concentrating development in areas where adequate sewerage facilities roads and schools can be provided and limiting development in areas where these facilities are not and should not be provided. 102.04. regulating and restricting the location and use of buildings structures and land for trade industry residences and other uses. 102.05. providing standards for all types of dwelling units so that all the people may have access to decent sound and sanitary housing in accordance with the goals of the federal housing act of 1949 among which is the provision of adequate zoning to meet a fair share of the region s housing needs. 102.06. lessening the danger of congestion of traffic on the roads and highways limiting excessive numbers of intersections driveways and other friction points minimizing other hazards and insuring the continued usefulness of all elements of the existing highway system for their planned function. 102.07. securing safety from fire panic flood and other dangers. 102.08. providing adequate privacy light and air. 102.09. securing economy in local governmental expenditures. 102.10. conserving property values throughout auburn. 102.11. protecting landowners from adverse impacts of adjoining developments. 102.12. dividing the incorporated area of auburn into districts according to the use of land and buildings the intensity of such uses (including bulk and height) and surrounding open space. each purpose listed above serves to balance the interest of the general public of auburn and those of individual property owners. section 103. jurisdiction. this ordinance shall apply to all areas within the corporate limits of the city of auburn alabama. no building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected moved or altered unless for a use expressly permitted by and in conformity with the regulations

regulations impose greater restrictions than i-2 those specified in this ordinance compliance with such other ordinances and regulations shall be mandatory. application of the provisions of this

annul or otherwise interfere with any easement covenant or private agreement  provided however that where the provisions of this ordinance are more restrictive or impose higher standards the provisions of this ordinance shall apply. section 105. severability if any section clause or provision of this ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction such holding shall not affect any other section clause provision or portion of this ordinance which is not in and of itself invalid or unconstitutional. section 106. effective date this

is deemed the most appropriate zoning classification and a preliminary or final plat for development of the land has been approved by the planning commission. it is also intended to provide for in-filling of existing neighborhoods on vacant lots with single family detached dwellings as defined in section 203 of this ordinance. because there are a number of different lot sizes in the neighborhood conservation district the zoning map depicts these various areas with the letters  nc  sub-designated by a number. the number indicates the minimum lot size in thousands of square feet. for example nc-20 indicates that 20000 square feet is the minimum lot size for the district so designated. occupancy in nc zones is limited to the  family  as per section 203. 304.07 development district housing (ddh). the development district   housing (ddh) is a district that is designed to promote conventional and performance single family housing and/or provide a transition between the nc

intended to promote the renewal of those transitional areas of the city of auburn that have undergone extensive changes in land use type and density/intensity. transition from generally low density residential land use to higher residential densities and small-scale commercial office and institutional use has occurred in a haphazard manner much of it prior to enactment of current zoning regulations. this district provides regulations that permit redevelopment of an urban character. it provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses. the rdd is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize transitional neighborhoods thereby reducing the cost of growth in auburn. the rdd may not accommodate a substantially larger population as a result of redevelopment but the character stability and vitality of the district are projected to improve immensely. like the cdd this district allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. this ordinance

uses serving the local residents. such commercial uses will be limited in range scale and location  and will be subject to design standards intended to promote low-intensity commercial development that is consistent in character and appearance with surrounding residential areas. occupancy in the ldd is limited to the  family  as per section 203. 304.13 comprehensive development district (cdd). this district is intended to accommodate most of the growth expected in the undeveloped areas of auburn. it is to be provided with all public facilities (schools sewers water and highways) and will allow most uses by right. it is intended to provide the zoning and capital improvements that attract development. it consists of the areas where development should logically locate as a consequence of planned public facilities and associated capital expenditures. this district provides regulations that permit development of both urban and suburban character. it provides for low- to moderate-density residential development and for necessary commercial and institutional uses. iii-5 the cdd is designed to minimize the costs of extending or expanding public services. it is a planned logical accommodation of growth and is intended to serve areas suitable for development and to avoid unsuitable areas. uses that are so large as to be of regional importance are not permitted by right because these uses require specialized and different evaluation and have special locational considerations which may make a separate zoning district appropriate. major uses such as a regional shopping center will be considered as conditional uses. manufactured home parks commercial support uses and road service uses are permitted conditionally and industrial uses are not permitted. the cdd allows many and varied uses while placing the emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. segregation of uses has never provided adequate protection especially at the boundaries of use districts. this ordinance anticipates the likelihood   and desirability   of considerable mixing of land uses and imposes standards to resolve any possible problems and eliminate the negative impacts of juxtaposing unlike land uses. occupancy in the cdd is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals except as otherwise provided by standards for institutional and special residential uses. 304.14. corridor redevelopment district (crd). this district is intended to promote the renewal of the traditional auto-oriented commercial corridors of the city of auburn. the areas with this designation were developed prior to the current zoning regulations and suffer from poor aesthetics and lack of economic diversity. this district provides regulations that permit redevelopment of a more urban or mixed-use character while protecting the economic viability of the corridor. it provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses. the crd is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize commercial corridors thereby reducing the cost of growth in auburn. the crd is not intended to accommodate a substantially larger population as a result of redevelopment but the character stability and vitality of the district are projected to improve. like the cdd this district allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. this zone therefore imposes standards to alleviate conflicts and eliminate negative impacts. the crd is divided into four unique sub-districts: corridor redevelopment district - urban (crd-u) corridor redevelopment district   east (crd-e) corridor redevelopment district   suburban (crd-s) and corridor redevelopment district   west (crd-w). the urban and east designations promotes more compact growth in those areas closer to the urban core. the suburban and west designations promotes growth with strong aesthetic and increased design guidance. occupancy in the crd-u crd-e and crd-s is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals except as otherwise provided by standards for institutional and special residential uses occupancy in the crd-w west of north donahue drive is limited to the  family  as per section 203. occupancy in the crd-w east of north donahue drive is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals except as otherwise provided by standards for institutional and special residential uses. 304.15 south college corridor district (sccd). this district is intended to accommodate commercial entertainment and services uses that not only serve the local community but also the greater region due to the proximity to the interstate highway. the district is provided with public facilities (sewer water and highways) and will allow most commercial uses by right. this district is not intended to accommodate residential or industrial uses. the district is intended to provide zoning and capital improvement that attract development that provides goods and services to a broad market beyond the community. the scdd is designed to accommodate growth of commercial uses that require a higher need of access and visibility for the regional shopping and hospitality markets. in addition to the commercial uses that are iii-6 permitted by right road service uses that are geared toward a retail consumer are permitted whereas most other road service uses are considered as conditional uses. since the scdd is a primarily commercial use district there is less need for minimizing impacts and nuisances within the district and more emphasis on access and circulation between properties and uses. 304.16. industrial district (i). this district is intended to accommodate industrial areas that must be segregated because of negative impacts that cannot be made compatible with other uses through the application of performance standards. the creation of this separate district for industrial use recognizes not only nuisances but also infrastructure and operational incompatibilities between its permitted uses and those of other districts. accordingly the standards for this district are designed to accommodate intensive industrial uses that generate nuisances which either cannot be handled by technology or which are nearly impossible to police. locational criteria for this district focus on transportation requiring that sites have access to a railroad an airport or a major expressway. 304.17 planned development district (pdd). this district is intended to provide an opportunity for a land development process with the greatest flexibility available to the developer consistent with the provisions of these regulations and the provisions included in the master development plan for the subject property. the pdd designation may be requested and considered for application only to those properties already zoned ddh mdrd nrd cdd ldd rdd crd and sccd. approval of a planned development district (pdd) shall be based upon the approval of a master development plan (section 505) for the site in question. the approved master development plan shall establish the allowable uses densities street and building configuration open space amenities and buffering. uses shall be selected from those listed conditionally in table 4-1 following a thorough evaluation of the propose location of any pdd. following the acceptance of the master development plan the property shall receive the pdd zoning designation. 304.18. conservation overlay district (cod). this district is intended to promote the health safety and general welfare of the public by encouraging the conservation and enhancement of the city s source of water supply and natural resource environment. the purposes of the district are: 1. to protect water quality in the lake ogletree subwatershed 2. to permanently preserve unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater floodplains wetlands streams and woodlands within the city of auburn 3. to offer developers and landowners alternatives to standard development of land 4. to provide flexibility to allow for creativity in development 5. to foster less sprawl and more efficient use of land streets and utilities  and 6. to permit clustering of buildings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils in order to reduce the amount of infrastructure including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential and commercial development. 304.19. holding district (hd). this district encompasses those land which are owned or operated by governmental entities and are exempt from the regulations of this code and those lands which are set aside for public institutional uses and the protection of vital natural resources. the purpose of the holding district in relation to government-owned lands is to acknowledge their presence within the city limits while recognizing that such areas are not subject to local zoning requirements. if and when any hd-designated property comes under private ownership the planning commission shall assign the appropriate zoning designation. article iv. general regulations section 400. introduction. the purpose of the regulations contained in this article is to allow maximum utilization of land while insuring against detrimental impacts on the environment neighboring properties and the public interest. this insurance is provided by separating the incorporated area of the city of auburn into 19 zoning districts and permitting specified land uses within each provided that a use meets all the additional criteria specified in this ordinance. this regulatory approach has been termed  performance zoning  because it permits a use to be developed on a particular parcel only if that use meets  performance  standards which have been enacted to insure against the use causing or having the potential to cause the negative impacts mentioned above. the format of the regulations in this ordinance and particularly in this article differs somewhat from that of traditional zoning ordinances because performance zoning requires that consideration be given to site parcel characteristics and the range of impacts that any land use may have. section 401. use regulations. section 402 through 407 identify the category of use and define the specific uses shown in table 4-1 - table of permitted uses. section 408 and table 4-1 indicate which land uses may locate by right by conditional use or are not permitted in each zoning district. in addition section 408 provides special developments standards for uses that are permitted or conditional permitted in each zoning district. section 402. use

surface coverage and lot area that apply in each zoning district. the purpose of these performance standards is to provide detailed regulations and restrictions by means of minimum criteria which must be met in order to protect neighbors from adverse impacts of proposed land uses and to protect the general health safety and welfare by limiting where uses may be established insuring that traffic congestion is minimized controlling the intensity of use and prescribing other such performance criteria as necessary to implement the goals and objectives of this ordinance. this ordinance depends on a comprehensive performance evaluation process to insure compatibility between neighboring land uses. section 410. compliance. all uses and activities shall comply fully with the provisions of the following standards as a precondition of development approval. section 411. performance standards. this section contains the basic standards applicable to the districts and uses allowed by this ordinance. the standards of tables 4-2 and 4-3 shall apply to each district and use therein. all standards must be met. some development standards shown in tables 4-2 and 4-3 particularly maximum floor area ratio (far) and impervious surface ratio (isr) may differ from standards provided in table 4-4 or elsewhere in this ordinance  in all cases the strictest standard shall apply. all tracts of land within a district may be developed to the same density factor. however the number of units permitted per gross acre will vary from site to site due to differences in the amounts of resource protection land but will in no case exceed the maximum gross density established in table 4-2. the floor area ratio is the maximum amount of gross floor area of all floors of a building permitted on the site. impervious surface ratios are calculated separately for areas and/or parts of a development site that are separated by a public road railroad or other feature that affects surface drainage. the base-zoning district from which they were rezoned shall govern densities and open space ratios for uses in planned development districts. when a planned development district encompasses property with more than one original zoning designation the density and open space ratio shall be derived from the calculated average figure based on the acreage within each original zoning designation. this average may be applied across the overall site without regard for the original designation. 411.01. building setbacks. a. minimum setbacks. to calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure adequate light air and privacy to abutting properties multiply the height of the proposed building by the angle of light exposure factor for the zoning district as shown in table 4-3 below. the product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the property line. if based on this calculation the setback required is greater than the minimum width of the required bufferyard the setback according to the angle of light exposure factor must be used. b. maximum setbacks. where lots have double frontage the maximum setback shall apply to the frontage upon any designated corridor (section 429). for corner properties the maximum setback shall be measured from the property line of both rights-of-way. this setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements. iv-30 recessed portions of any proposed structure designed for outdoor seating dining or events shall be allowed under the requirements of this section following the review and approval of the planning commission. such recesses shall be clearly illustrated on the site plan.

plans for development shall be a violation of this ordinance. reference in this section to  open space  is intended to mean the term as it is defined by article ii and described in section 417. section 413. stream buffer. 413.01. purpose. the purpose of this section is to establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of buffers to ensure that the stream and adjacent land will fulfill their natural functions  to reduce land development impacts on stream water quality and flows  and to provide for the environmentally sound use of auburn s land resources. 413.02. definitions. for the purpose of this section the following words or phrases shall be defined as specified below. a. perennial stream: see article ii definitions stream perennial b. intermittent stream: a stream that flows at least six months out of a year but does not flow during part or all of the summer and may carry water during or after a rainstorm. c. ephemeral stream: a stream channel or reach of stream channel that carries surface water runoff for short durations as a result of precipitation events. the channel bottom is always above the groundwater table. d. best management practices (bmps): conservation practices or management measures that control soil loss and reduce water quality degradation caused by nutrients animal wastes toxics sediment and runoff. 413.03. streams determination. perennial and intermittent streams are identified through site inspection by the water resource management department and/or us geological survey (usgs) maps. perennial streams are those which are normally depicted on a usgs map with a solid blue line. intermittent streams are normally depicted on a usgs map with a dotted blue line. perennial and intermittent streams not identified on the usgs map as described herein may be added to a development site plan by the water resource management department based on the determination by a qualified professional that the stream satisfies the usgs definition for said streams. ephemeral streams are streams assessed and determined by the water resource management department through stream delineation done on the development site as reported by a qualified professional. 413.04. buffer description width and permitted uses. stream buffers shall be required on each side of all perennial and intermittent streams as defined in section 413.02 and further described in section 413.03. stream buffers width shall vary based on the size of the upstream drainage basin. table 4.31 specifies the buffer required based on the drainage area for a particular stream above the most downstream point on the development being considered. the usgs 7.5 minute 1 :2000  quadrangle maps in conjunction with the soil survey maps of lee county and the city of auburn geographic information system (gis) will serve as tools to delineate the size of drainage basins and specify the corresponding buffer width. the stream buffer is comprised of three zones: streamside zone managed use zone and upland zone. buffer zones function vegetation and permitted uses vary by zone as described in the table 4.32. iv-36 table 4.31 stream buffer width based on drainage area drainage area (watershed) designation streamside zone managed use zone upland zone total buffer width on each side of stream < 100 acres 25 feet none 10 feet 35 feet > 100 acres 25 feet none 20 feet 45 feet > 300 acres 25 feet 20 feet 10 feet 55 feet > 640 acres 25 feet 50 feet 25 feet 100 feet if an ephemeral stream remains after construction has been completed and all or a portion of that stream falls within the stream buffer of an intermittent or perennial stream then that ephemeral stream shall be revegetated on both sides of the stream in accordance with the targeted vegetation of the corresponding buffer zone. appropriate stream bank stabilization measures shall be designed if warranted by excessive velocities in the ephemeral stream. if the ephemeral stream remains after construction and falls outside of an intermittent/perennial stream buffer then that ephemeral stream shall be grassed and/or revegetated in accordance with the surrounding vegetation at a width of 25 feet on each side of the ephemeral stream. ephemeral stream channels and banks shall be stabilized as appropriate for the predicted stream velocities. these measures are performed in order to preserve and protect water quality. table 4.32 stream buffer description and permitted uses characteristics streamside managed use zone upland zone function protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem protects key components of the stream and provides distance between upland development and the streamside zone prevents encroachment and filter runoff from

approved by the water resource management department 413.05. applicability. the buffer requirements shall apply to all perennial and intermittent streams defined in section 413.02. buffer widths for streams are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water landward from the top of the bank on each side of the stream. the top of bank is the landward edge of the stream channel during high water or bank full conditions at the point where the water leaves the stream channel and begins to overflow onto the floodplain. iv-37 all properties shall be subject to the buffer width requirements except those properties that are an existing lot of record and/or included on an approved preliminary subdivision plat and the lot or lots cannot meet the requirements described in this section. (effective date 5/02/06 pursuant to ordinance number 2389) 413.06. minimize intrusion. any uses allowed in table 4.32 shall be designed and constructed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the stream buffer and to minimize clearing grading erosion and water quality degradation. 413.07. land in the stream buffer. land in stream buffers shall not be used for principal structures. all new platted lots shall be designed to provide sufficient land outside of the stream buffer to accommodate primary structures. stream buffers should be delineated before streets and lots are laid out to minimize buffer intrusion and to assure adequate buildable area on each platted lot. land within the stream buffer can serve to meet the minimum lot size requirements. 413.08. setback requirements. for all lots within a development requiring a stream buffer setbacks can be 100% within the stream buffer. 413.09. buffer impact. when the application of the buffer zones would result in the loss of buildable area on a lot (see section 203 for definition of  lot ) that was recorded prior to the amendment of this ordinance modifying the width of the buffer zones may be allowed through an administrative process as determined by the water resource management department. modification and mitigation of the stream buffer width are also available to landowners or developers of newly platted lots or subdivisions where there are exceptional situations or physical conditions on the parcel that pose practical difficulty to its development and restrict the application of the regulations of this ordinance. there must be proof of such circumstances by the landowner. the landowner or his designated representative proposing any of the impacts shall prepare and submit for approval a written request and a site plan showing the extent of the proposed impact and must specify a proposed mitigation technique. mitigation techniques are included in section 413.10. the water resource management department and other appropriate city staff members shall review and render a decision on any buffer encroachment and mitigation technique with regard to the stream buffer requirements. amendment to the stream buffer width may be allowed in accordance with the following criteria: a. the proposed encroachment and mitigation is in accordance with the purpose and intent of this section of the ordinance. b. the proposed lot and structure conforms to all other zoning and development regulations. c. encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utility. d. the landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable written statement justifying the need for the buffer impact. e. the landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable mitigation plan in accordance with cited mitigation techniques. f. attention has been given to maintaining natural vegetation and eliminating run-off. in no case shall the reduced portion of the buffer area be less than the width of the streamside zone (25 feet). iv-38 413.10. stream buffer mitigation techniques. the following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation of buffer impact. a. installation of structural bmps. the installation of an on-site structural bmp (i.e. bioretention extended detention/retention rain gardens stormwater wetlands etc.) will allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. the structural bmp shall be designed to achieve pollutant (nutrients herbicides pesticides sediment and other illicit discharges) removal to the maximum extent practicable. the bmp shall remain outside the streamside zone. a detailed bmp design plan must be submitted to the water resource management department for approval along with a long-term maintenance plan. b. controlled impervious surface. the landowner may commit to and provide a specific site development plan that limits the overall site impervious surface ratio equal to or less than 25%. c. open space development. the landowner may submit a specific site development plan which preserves an undisturbed vegetative area on-site or near the development site as open space equal to 200% of the buffer encroachment area. the open space preserved must promote water quality protection. d. stream restoration: the landowner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area the condition of which is determined to be qualified for restoration by the water resource management department on a 1:1 basis in linear feet of stream. this restoration shall include stream bank improvements and streamside and managed use zone re-vegetation. e. stream preservation: the landowner may purchase fee simple other stream segments within the city limits at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple and absolute title of the land to the city. f. wetland restoration: on a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (2 acres of wetland for each acre of disturbed area) the landowner may provide a combination of the preservation and/or restoration of wetlands with protective easements and the implementation of structural or nonstructural bmps to achieve pollutant removal to the maximum extent practicable. g. greenways: the landowner may allocate and donate open space within the city limits through fee simple to the city of auburn for preservation and use as common open space. h. wider buffer widths: a developer may add additional widths to buffer areas where encroachment occurs in other areas on a development site and may obtain an acre for acre credit based on the stream buffer zone impacted. a 2:1 credit could be obtained by determination of the water resource management department in the event additional streamside buffer is set aside for encroachment of the managed use and upland stream buffer zones. i. other mitigation techniques: other creative mitigation techniques and plans may be considered by the water resource management department. 413.11. vegetation preservation. the buffer shall provide for the preservation and enhancement of natural vegetation or planting. no live vegetation may be removed from the streamside and managed use zones for preparation of land for uses permitted in table 4.32 unless approved by the water resource management department. the water resource management department may grant approval of the removal of exotic vegetation (i.e. privet kudzu etc.) provided that a vegetation restoration plan is submitted and approved prior to the disturbance of the vegetation. the purpose of such plan is to ensure that native vegetation is restored to the streamside zone. where a developer or lot owner removes live vegetation from the buffer strip in violation of this section the water resource management department shall require native vegetation of reasonable diameter in size to be planted so as iv-39 to create a buffer area which is in compliance with this section. a vegetation restoration plan must be submitted and approved by the water resource management department prior to restoration. 413.12. vegetation restoration plan. a vegetation restoration plan shall include the following information: a. scaled map of lot showing buffer delineation (copy of the survey is acceptable). b. square footage of the actual area disturbed or proposed disturbed area. c. proposed vegetation to be removed from the buffer. d. proposed location number and species of plants to be planted in the disturbed area (see list of plant species). e. type of ground cover to be placed in the disturbed area (i.e. mulch pine straw etc.). f. proposed planting schedule and deadline for completion of restoration activities. 413.13. buffer delineation. the following buffer delineations are required: a. stream boundaries including each buffer zone must be clearly delineated on all grading plans subdivision plats site plans and any other development plans. b. the outside boundaries of the managed use zone of the stream buffer must be clearly marked onsite by flagging or fencing prior to land disturbing activities. c. the outside boundary of the managed use zone must be permanently marked at highway stream crossings. d. stream and buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all surveys and recorded plats and noted on individual deeds. e. stream buffer requirements must be referenced in homeowners association documents. 413.14. approved permits. where a landowner or his representative obtain permits from alabama department of environmental management (adem) or the u. s. army corp of engineers for proposed impact to the stream or stream buffers then these approved mitigation impacts and plans would supersede the applicable requirements of these sections of the ordinance. the regulations that these permits do not affect shall be applicable to the proposed development site. section 414. reclamation of undeveloped land. in the event that construction of a development has not begun in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance or has not been completed within one year of initiation said development shall be reviewed by the planning commission at its next regular meeting following the expiration of the one-year period. at this meeting the planning commission shall determine whether or not reasonable progress toward completion of the development is being made. evidence of reasonable progress toward completion may include but shall not be limited to installation of streets utility lines and stormwater management facilities  laying structural foundations  and completion of any stage of a development approved under a staging plan pursuant to section 802.09(a). however the clearing and grubbing of land in the absence of other improvements shall not by itself constitute evidence of reasonable progress. upon a determination that reasonable progress is not being made the planning commission may require the owner of the development site to restore the land to the same condition that existed prior to the initiation of the development. if such restoration is not feasible the city engineer and the planning director shall determine and prescribe an acceptable condition or degree of reclamation  at the very least the site shall be sodded or planted in grass and appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent or eliminate soil erosion. in all cases restoration activities shall be consistent with appropriate best management practices as recommended by the alabama forestry commission the iv-40 alabama department of environmental management (adem) and/or the natural resources conservation service (nrcs). section 415. floodplains. development within or affecting a floodplain shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations requirements and specifications of section 7.5 fema requirements of the auburn public works design and construction manual. 415.01. permanent open space. all such areas shall be permanent open space. no uses or improvements other than those permitted herein shall be permitted in any area consisting of floodplain as defined by this ordinance. 415.02. permitted uses. the following uses are permitted within the floodplain as a matter of right: a. all uses that are permitted in designated open spaces. b. all uses that are classified as agriculture nurseries and outdoor recreation. c. piers bridges and bridge approaches and picnic shelters so long as the building permit application shows that a licensed engineer has certified that such structures are designed to withstand the forces exerted by the 100-year flood event at that location. section 416. steep slopes. development on steep slopes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations requirements and specifications of section 4.3.1.1   review and approval of construction best management practices plans of the auburn water resource management design and construction manual. all steep slope areas as determined by the water resource management department shall be identified on the construction best management practices plan and on any subdivision plats. section 417. open space. the open space requirements of table 4-2 and this section shall apply to residential development only. land that is required by this ordinance to remain as open space may be used for the recreation agriculture resource protection amenity and other purposes specified in this section. open-space land shall be freely accessible to all residents of a development with the exception that agricultural land uses shall be permitted to restrict access to that land to those solely engaged in agricultural pursuits. open space shall have qualities making it useful to residents of the development for either passive or active recreation and will be developed to serve that purpose  or shall serve an important visual role in separating the development from existing public ways or from other existing or potential developments  or shall be of value in dividing the development into coherent sub-areas. non-recreational buildings except those related to agricultural uses permitted under section 417.01(c) shall not occupy open-space land. 417.01. all developments required by this ordinance to provide open space shall meet the following requirements. a. land designated as open space shall be maintained as open space and may not be separately sold subdivided or developed and no structures shall be built on such land except as provided below. all such properties shall be owned and maintained by the developer owner of the development site homeowners association or other private entity. b. an open-space plan shall be submitted as a part of the application for a site plan or subdivision approval. this plan shall designated and indicate the boundaries of all open-space areas required by this ordinance. the plan shall: 1. designate areas to be reserved as open space. the specific design of open-space areas shall be sensitive to the physical and design characteristics of the site. 2. designate the type of open space as established in this section that will be provided. 3. specify the manner in which the open space shall be perpetuated maintained and administered in accordance with section 417. iv-41 c. the types of open space that may be provided to satisfy the requirements of this ordinance together with the maintenance required for each type are as follows: 1. natural areas are areas of undisturbed vegetation or areas replanted with vegetation after construction. woodlands and wetlands are specific types of natural areas. natural watercourses are to be maintained as free flowing and devoid of debris. stream channels shall be maintained so as not to alter floodplain levels. 2. agricultural uses specified in section 404.01. 3. garden plots are the division of open space into plots for cultivation as gardens. 4. recreational areas are areas designed for specific active recreational uses having minimal requirements for structures such as tennis courts swimming pools softball fields and golf courses. an enclosed structure shall be permitted in a recreational area only where it directly supports a specific facility and does not require off-street parking. recreational areas shall be accessible to all residents of the development. 5. greenways are linear green belts linking residential areas with other open-space areas. these greenways are encouraged to designate developed bicycle paths footpaths bridle paths fitness trails or other similar development. inter-connecting the greenway system between residences and recreational areas in encouraged. 6. commonly owned lawns consisting of grass with or without trees. d. open space shall be appropriately located and large enough to address the open space characteristics cited throughout section 417. 1. no dwelling unit shall be located more than 750 feet from designated open space. the planning commission may waive this distance requirement where the developer proposes a major recreational facility which will occupy at least 50 percent of the required open space for the development. no more than ten (10) percent of the dwelling units in the development may be occupied before this facility is completed and available for use. where intervening non-recreational properties separate a dwelling unit from an open space area the planning director may require an easement or other means of access for nonmotorized traffic to avoid the need for pedestrians to cross or travel on roads carrying vehicular traffic. 2. no parcel of property or portion thereof less than 40 feet wide and 7500 square feet in size shall be counted toward the designated open space requirement. open space areas containing paved or stabilized paths for pedestrians and/or bicycles shall be exempt from this requirement if such paths are part of a comprehensive circulation system serving a portion of the development. 3. all open space shall be easily visible and freely accessible. 4. the following shall not count toward fulfillment of designated open space requirements: a) platted lots for residential use or designated sites for manufactured homes or recreational vehicles b) easements for roads driveways or any other use which is not consistent with the purposes of open space as established in this section iv-42 c) required bufferyards in subdivisions where such bufferyards are located inside residential lots d) parking areas including planter islands planter strips and peninsulas containing required landscaping e) public or private right-of-way f) private roads and driveways g) areas of required spacing between structures manufactured homes or recreational vehicles h) areas which have been cleared of vegetation excavated filled or otherwise altered from their natural state unless such alteration is consistent with the proposed use of the open space parcel i) any development site (as established by a site plan) containing a clubhouse or a non-recreational use including but not limited to office restaurants gift shops and groundskeeper storage buildings j) any other areas which the planning director finds to be inconsistent with the intent of this section. in addition no lake pond or other permanent water body shall constitute more than 25 percent of the total open space required for the development. no golf course shall constitute more than 60 percent of the total open space required for the development. 417.02. preservation of open space. open-space areas shall be maintained so that their use and enjoyment as open space is not diminished or destroyed. where open space is to be provided within a subdivision such areas shall be designated by creating separate parcels within the perimeter of the plat. these parcels shall be labeled as to their intended use and the plat shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility. where open space is provided within a development site which is the subject of a site plan and is under different ownership than the rest of the site it shall nevertheless remain part of the development site pursuant to section 802.11. unless the site plan is modified or terminated in accordance with section 802.08 the open space areas shall be used only as provided in section 417. the site plan shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility. open-space areas may be owned preserved and maintained as required by this section by any of the following mechanisms or combinations thereof: a. common ownership of the open space by a homeowner s association which assumes full responsibility for its maintenance. b. deed-restricted private ownership that shall prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision of the open-space land and provide the maintenance responsibility. this arrangement shall be noted on the site plan and/or subdivision plat. full and proper legal documentation shall be submitted to the planning director prior to commencement of development activities. section 418. land use intensity classification and bufferyards and structure height. all land uses that are permitted by this ordinance have been assigned a land use intensity class designation. this classification system separates uses on the basis of the type and degree of  nuisance  or negative impact they are likely to impose on land uses adjacent to them. iv-43 bufferyards are required to protect one class of use from adverse impacts caused by a use in another class or to ameliorate the impact two uses in the same class may have on one another. bufferyards between two uses in the same land use intensity class are not required in this ordinance for classes v-xi because the principal intent is to buffer residential uses (found only in classes i-iv) from nonresidential uses. however the planning commission may require bufferyards between two uses of the same intensity in classes v-xi or between two uses of different intensity where bufferyards are not required by the ordinance if it appears that problems will result from placing unlike land uses side by side without a bufferyard. this regulation benefits both the developer and the adjoining landowner(s) because it allows the developer several options from which to choose in developing the property while insuring each neighbor adequate protection regardless of the developer s choice. each land use is listed in one or more use intensity classes. a use must meet all the standards specified for that use in table 4-4. the standards that apply to the highest intensity class for a use shall be the maximum intensity permitted for that use. there are standards that set maximum density impervious surface ratio floor area and height. steeples bell towers clock towers cupolas and similar ornamental/architectural features may exceed structure height by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning district. chimneys ventilators utility service structures solar panels flag poles fire escapes stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit by 12 feet. exclusions from structure height are parapet walls (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend. exclusions shall not exceed in cross sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building. exclusions from structure height shall not include accessory rooftop structures such as greenhouses pigeon houses enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and similar structures. un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools and jogging tracks shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does not exceed the height limit of the respective zoning district. section 419. land use intensity class standards. in keeping with the concept that performance should be the relevant measure of any land use regulations the following section classifies uses according to their respective impacts (all uses within a use class are considered to have an equal impact on neighboring uses). a developer may develop at an intensity that will minimize nuisances to neighbors or provide a denser bufferyard if the land is developed at greater intensities. the impacts of greater intensity may include greater impervious surface coverage with associated increased runoff heat generation reduced percolation and open space increased bulk and height of buildings increased traffic with associated noise and congestion signs and exterior lighting visible from neighboring property late hours of operation and other nuisances. thus for example an office use on any lot may meet the standards of intensity classes v vi vii viii or ix (see table 4-4). the range of intensity classes open to a use does not affect whether it can locate on its lot but only how it can develop on that lot. performance standards are specified for each intensity class  exceeding any single standard in an intensity class moves a use to the next higher intensity class. in the event that a use does not appear in the next higher intensity class it may not exceed any single criterion in the highest intensity class in which it is listed.

bufferyards. the bufferyard is the buffer together with the planting required thereon. the bufferyard requirements of this ordinance are designed to minimize nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public road. the purpose of the buffer is to separate different land uses from each other in order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and unsightly buildings or parking areas or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise odor or danger from fires or explosions. in addition to creating a separation a buffer determines the building setback for all performance developments except where other setbacks are more restrictive. a structure in a performance development may require a setback greater than the width of the bufferyard depending on the height of the structure. this determination shall be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 502.03. iv-47 the purpose of the planting is to create a visual separation between uses and to enhance the beauty of the city. this is accomplished through preservation protection and planting of trees particularly those trees recognized herein as canopy and understory trees. the intent is to derive all the benefits of having trees shrubs and other plant materials. among the benefits are: minimizing temperature elevation reducing noise and wind reduction reducing stormwater runoff and flooding preventing soil erosion producing of oxygen fostering air quality through carbon dioxide absorption providing shelter and food for birds and other wildlife and softening the visual impact of development from public view and adjacent property. all these benefits contribute to a higher quality of life and enhance the appeal and economic value of both residential and business properties of the city. 420.02. bufferyard application. this ordinance requires that bufferyards be provided between uses in all districts except in the urban core (uc) district urban neighborhood (un-e un-w and un-s) district neighborhood redevelopment district (nrd) the industrial (i) district and the neighborhood conservation district. bufferyards between uses in these zones are not required except in cases where single-family residences occur on land abutting development in uc un-e un-w un-s nrd or i zoning districts (see tables 4-5 and 4-7). in addition property located in an industrial district that has frontage along a designated corridor (see section 429) must comply with the thoroughfare frontage bufferyard requirements (section 429.06) and a 10-foot wide bufferyard with two (2) canopy trees per 100 linear feet is required for all development adjacent to all streets in the industrial district. planting materials are specified in section 426. conventional subdivisions shall also be exempt from bufferyard requirements. where bufferyards are required between uses and zoning districts they shall adhere to the buffer width requirements shown on tables 4-5 through 4-7 and the number and types of planting specified in section 426. the requirements of this article shall be met for all development sites and developments as defined in article ii. this includes vacant redeveloped or developed sites that require a zoning certificate that involve changes in land use category as defined in sections 404 through 408 or that are subject to a conditional use permit. sites that are nonconforming as per article vii of this ordinance and cannot physically meet the requirements of article iv will be subject to minimum acceptable bufferyard requirements of section 707. 420.03. location of bufferyards. bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or right-of-way but may include easements at the discretion of the planning water resource management and/or public works departments. 420.04. use of bufferyards. a bufferyard may be used for passive recreation  it may contain unpaved walkways or trails provided that: (a) no required plant material is eliminated  (b) the specified width of the bufferyard is maintained  and (c) all other regulations of the ordinance are met. in no event however shall the following be permitted in bufferyards: playing fields stables swimming pools basketball courts tennis courts parking spaces or merchandise display. no accessory structures other than signs authorized under article vi shall be permitted in the bufferyards. no impervious surfaces shall be permitted in a bufferyard except sidewalks paved driveways or access roads that may cross a bufferyard in providing vehicular or pedestrian access to a public street. in approving such access points the planning director shall determine: (a) that no more are proposed than necessary for the safety and convenience of persons entering and leaving the development site  and (b) that the access points have been designed so as to minimize the interference with the purposes of the bufferyard. 420.05. ownership of bufferyards. bufferyards constitute an integral part of a development site and may not be subdivided sold dedicated or otherwise conveyed separately from the development site of which they are a part. the city shall not approve any development plan in which a required bufferyard or any portion of a required bufferyard lies on land which is not part of the development site. 420.06. responsibility for bufferyard. all bufferyards in their entirety are the responsibility of the owner(s) of the development site on which they are located. no required bufferyard shall be divided by a boundary between different development sites. bufferyards within performance subdivisions shall be dedicated to and maintained by a homeowners  association or equivalent organization  such dedication shall be indicated on the final plat prior to recording. where a required bufferyard is located on common property said common property shall be owned by the homeowners  association. iv-48 where a required bufferyard crosses a privately owned lot a bufferyard easement of the required width shall be created on the lot said easement being held by the homeowners  association. where required bufferyards are absent destroyed or in need of maintenance and a homeowners  association does not exist or is inactive individual property owners shall be responsible for their respective shares of the bufferyard. fines assessed under section 909 may be used by the city to provide the required landscaping. bufferyards on common property are the joint responsibility of all property owners within the development site who shall be assessed equal shares of any city expenses incurred in restoring such bufferyards. 420.07. maintenance of bufferyard areas. all buffer areas and plant materials shall be maintained by the owner occupant tenant and/or respective agent of each such bufferyard so that the purpose and effect of the bufferyard is not diminished. the following minimum maintenance activities are required: a. replacement of plant materials destroyed by any cause. in the case any trees or shrubs are destroyed by natural causes plant size in terms of caliper height and gallon as the original planting must be used as a replacement. if trees are removed or destroyed by the willful act of the property owner occupant tenant contractor and/or respective agent of each replacement trees of a greater caliper than the original planting may be required as determined by the planning director. b. repair and/or replacement of fences and walls that deteriorate or are damaged by any cause. c. restoration of bufferyards that are altered by erosion construction or other causes. failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall be deemed a violation of the ordinance. violators will be given written notice of the violation and permitted 15 days to correct the violation or submit a landscape plan and planting schedule before a citation is issued. thereafter each day shall be considered a separate offense and shall be punishable by the maximum fine established by the city council of auburn. the planning commission as part of conditional use approval may select a more restrictive bufferyard than the one required in table 4-5 4-6 or 4-7. 420.08. bufferyard requirements. bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the buffer and type and quantity of planting materials. the type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard and structure type option are specified in sections 426 through 428. a structure type is a wall fence or berm erected to satisfy bufferyard requirements. the structure type requirements of a bufferyard requiring such may be satisfied by any of the options illustrated. the options within any bufferyard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness in attenuating the impact of adjoining uses. figures 4-2 and 4-3 graphically indicate the structure type options for certain types of bufferyards (see tables 4-5 through 4-7). sections 426 and 427 specify species and size of plant materials and recommended minimum planting areas. plant materials identified in section 426 shall satisfy the requirements of this ordinance. any variation from plantings in appendix a will be reviewed by the planning department staff in conjunction with consultation with the city arborist. appropriate landscaping materials for bufferyards include but are not limited to turf grass trees shrubs and seasonal color as well as stone rocks and mulch. where mulch is used the area must be kept free of weeds. section 421. determination of bufferwidth. to determine the width of a buffer required between two (2) adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street the following procedure shall be followed: a. identify the land use category of the proposed use by referring to sections 404 through 408. b. identify the use category of the land use(s) adjacent to the proposed use by on-site survey. c. identify the land use intensity class of all adjoining land uses by referring to table 4-4. the city will supply this information. iv-49 d. determine the buffer required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by referring to tables 4-5 through 4-7. e. determine the street classification of adjacent streets by using appendix b for use in table 4-7. f. calculate the required setback based on the building height in accordance with section 502.03. tables 4-5 through 4-7 specify the widths of the buffer required between adjacent existing land uses and streets. buffer width averaging shall be permitted along individual property lines as long as the overall width is maintained. the width of the buffer shall not be less than five (5) feet in any location. the buffer widths cited constitute the total buffer required on the subject property based on the nature of the adjoining land use. the planning commission as part of conditional use approval may select a more appropriate buffer than the one(s) required in table 4-5 4-6 or 4-7. table 4-5: buffer width requirements for adjacent existing land uses by land use intensity class proposed l.u. intensity land

to all streets. section 422. general landscaping requirements. 422.01. landscaping requirements. this section details the general planting required on a particular development site. a tree inches per acre system shall be used to determine the number and types of trees required on a development site. table 4-8 specifies the required inches per acre and the required number of shrubs based on the size of the development site. the procedure for calculating the number and types of trees required on a development site is as follows: a. determining the total tree inches required on a development site. to obtain the required number and type of planting materials find the tree inches that correspond with the acreage of the development site. if the acreage of the development site is not a whole number round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the total tree inches. multiply the tree inches by the actual acreage of the development site. round all numbers to the nearest whole number. this number is the total inches of trees to be planted on the development site. if the property abuts a conventional residential subdivision see section 426.03 for additional tree inches to be added to the total inches of trees calculated. b. determining the minimum number of canopy and understory trees. before determining the number of canopy and understory trees a 60:40 ratio (canopy tree inches to understory tree inches) iv-51 shall be applied to the total tree inches. once tree inches for each type have been determined the tree inches will be converted into the number of trees to be required on the site. canopy trees: multiply the total inches of trees by sixty percent (60%) to get the tree inches to be devoted to canopy trees. to convert the tree inches to actual tree count the inches for canopy trees should be divided by 2 which is the minimum caliper for canopy trees. the quotient is the number of canopy trees to be planted on the development site. understory trees: take the total tree inches and multiply it by forty percent (40%) to get the tree inches to be devoted to understory trees. to convert the inches to actual tree count the inches for understory trees should be divided by one (1) which is the minimum caliper for understory trees. this number is the actual number of understory trees to be planted on the development site. again this number may be diminished by any applicable tree preservation credits (see section 427). example: 1.5 acres   53 inches (tree inches for 2 acres) = 79.5 round to 80 inches of trees 80   60% = 48 inches 48   2.0 caliper = 24 canopy trees 80   40% = 32 inches 32   1.0 caliper = 32 understory trees the owner would be required to plant 24 canopy trees and 32 understory trees for a total of 56 trees. if the owner decides to plant all canopy trees he would plant 40 canopy trees and no understory trees on the development site. c. minimum standards. an owner shall be allowed to exceed the minimum number of trees on a development site as long as the total required tree inches have been met. the total tree inches required on a development site may be met by planting all canopy trees but not by planting all understory trees. the maximum number of understory trees shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the total tree inches. d. shrubs. the number of shrubs to be planted on the development site is found on table 4-8. the number of shrubs is determined by the size of the development site. if the acreage of the development site is not a whole number round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the number of shrubs per acre. then multiply the number of shrubs per acre by the actual acreage of the development site. the product is the number of shrubs to be planted on the development site. example: 1.5   84 (shrubs for 2 acres) = 126 shrubs e. landscaping near utilities. canopy trees shall not be placed within 10 feet of existing or proposed underground utilities or on designated utility easements. 422.02. street frontage landscaping requirements. required buffer width (see table 4-7) canopy trees inches (per 100 feet) understory trees inches (per 100 feet) shrubs (number of) (per 100 feet) 10 feet 3 inches 3 inches 8 15 feet 4 inches 4 inches 10 sites with narrow street frontages in proportion to the total acreage may be granted a waiver by the planning director or his designee. the applicant is required to request the waiver in letter form with the submitted landscape plans. iv-52 existing trees located in the street frontage buffer area may receive credits if the trees are protected in accordance with section 429. the required number of canopy tree inches must be installed unless the planning director or his or her designee deems that the canopy tree will conflict with utilities. in such cases the total number of tree inches may be installed using understory trees. example: a street has a linear frontage of 250 feet and requires a 15 foot buffer. using the table above they would be required to have at least five (5) 2-inch canopy trees ten (10) 1-inch understory trees and 25 shrubs. this would equate to 20 tree inches in the bufferyard including 10 canopy and 10 understory tree inches. using the tree inch method the applicant could use larger trees to reduce number of total trees required. if the applicant used 4-inch canopy trees and 2-inch understory trees he or she could install three (3) canopy trees and five (5) understory trees. furthermore the applicant could install five (5) 4-inch canopy trees and not be required to install any understory trees. should a street master tree plan be implemented for a particular street which the development site fronts  the plantings from the street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for that particular frontage. 422.03. residential buffer landscaping requirements. additional planting materials shall be added to the landscaping requirements for property that abuts a conventional subdivision. twenty (20) tree inches per 100 linear feet of buffer area shall be added to the inches per acre requirements for any property lines abutting conventional residential development. the 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to determine the number of canopy versus understory trees to be planted. shrubbery shall be provided between plantings at thirty-five (35) shrubs per 100 feet. planting materials for a residential buffer shall be installed in the buffer area along the property line(s) abutting a conventional residential subdivision. under no circumstances can these inches be allocated to other areas on the development site. development sites which are separated from conventional subdivisions by the railroad right-of-way are exempt from this requirement. 422.04. off-street parking landscaping requirements. wherever a bufferyard required under section 420.08 overlaps or coincides with a parking area as defined in this section the bufferyard shall take precedence  planting required under this section shall be placed in another location. existing canopy understory and shrub species may be counted as contributing to the total landscaping required provided they are located within areas addressed by this section. the type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this section are specified in section 426 plant materials. landscape areas shall be provided in the interior parking area to break the expanse of pavement provide visual relief and minimize temperature elevation from the expanse of asphalt. landscape areas shall consist of planter islands planter strips or peninsula types. in order to count toward the off-street parking landscape requirements a planter island planter strip or peninsula shall have a minimum area of three-hundred four (304) square feet with a minimum width of nine (9) feet (hereafter referred to as contributing landscape areas). peninsulas may be designed within or adjacent to the interior parking area. the square footage of each planter island planter strip or peninsula within the parking lot must be shown  all contributing landscape areas should be designated on the landscape plan by shading or otherwise differentiated from any non-contributing landscape area. foundation landscaping (landscaping immediately adjacent to building) shall not be considered interior parking area landscaping. figure 4-1 graphically illustrates the area that constitutes the interior parking area and the landscape area types. the total area provided for off-street parking landscaping shall comply with one of the following options: option 1: one (1) contributing landscape island is required for every sixteen (16) parking spaces in a parking lot. the requirements of this section shall apply to all off-street parking areas containing twelve (12) or more paved parking spaces. if an existing parking lot is expanded or improved to add twelve (12) or more spaces it shall comply with the off-street parking landscaping requirements of this ordinance within the expanded or improved portion. iv-53 option 2: a minimum of 10% of the interior parking lot shall be landscaped. the boundary of the interior parking area must be shown on the landscape plan. the interior parking lot area is that area inside of the parking lot curb or edge of pavement consisting of parking spaces drive aisles driveways and immediately adjacent areas including all landscape areas. the maximum distance in any direction between islands and peninsulas shall be one hundred eighty (180) feet and one hundred twenty (120) feet for planter strips measured from the closest landscaped planting area curb edge. a minimum of one (1) canopy tree shall be required for and must be planted in each contributing landscaped island or peninsula regardless of the tree credits received. larger contributing landscape areas shall require one (1) additional canopy tree for each additional three hundred four (304) square feet of area (i.e. a six hundred eight (608) square foot contributing landscape area requires two (2) canopy trees. any additional landscaped areas beyond the required number may be planted with understory trees and/or shrubs. one (1) canopy tree per one-hundred (100) linear feet shall be planted in continuous planter strips. the remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs and/or other ground covering. in some instances these requirements of section 420.07 may require planting materials in excess of those required by section 422.05. existing canopy trees located elsewhere on the development site shall not count as contributing to the landscaping requirement for parking areas. all planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion by the installation of curbing or other wheel stops. parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more than two and a half feet as long as curbing or other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of the landscaped area. the city of auburn planning department and/or planning commission may vary the minimum off-street parking landscaping requirements if specific circumstances and/or site conditions warrant such action. under no circumstances can the landscaped areas be less than ninety (90) square feet with a minimum width of five (5) feet. the type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this section are specified in section 426 plant materials. 422.05. placement of plants and structures. the exact placement of required plants and structure types shall be the decision of each user  however no less than 40% of the  general landscape  material installed on a development site must be located in a buffer area when bufferyards are required. per the international fire code section 507.05  a 3- foot clear space shall be maintained around the circumference of fire hydrants.  there should be no obstruction preventing easy coupling of fire hoses or turning on the hydrant. the hydrant should be visible from all approaches. items such as shrubs brush posts and fences should not be placed or kept near fire hydrants. any remaining landscaping outside of the required bufferyards and parking landscaping should be placed to soften the facades of buildings. the plantings should be placed near the foundations of the buildings if possible. additionally all developments must submit a landscape plan showing landscaping required by this ordinance. see figures 4-2 and 4- 3 for structure types. 422.06. structures. the planning director may waive a structure (type 1 or 2) requirement on a performance residential development in the redevelopment district (rdd) comprehensive development district (cdd) and urban neighborhood (un-e un-w and un-s) zoning districts. the waiver will be considered where structures are required to abut certain outdoor recreational uses specifically parks picnic areas play fields and playground. the waiver request must be accompanied by a letter of justification from the applicant. 422.07. reuse of an existing site. for landscaping requirements for the reuse of an existing building refer to section 707 of this ordinance. the landscape requirements will be determined by the adjacent land uses and the location of the proposed new use. iv-54 table 4-8 tree inches

section 423. tree preservation credit. in order to encourage the conservation of existing trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects credit will be given for specimen trees and any other trees that are successfully preserved and protected in accordance with tree protection methods specified in section 425. in order for a tree to qualify for tree credit it must be identified on the landscape plan protected during land disturbance as required in section 425 and meet the all minimum standards outlined in this ordinance. the credit allowed for a freestanding tree shall be the actual diameter at breast height (dbh) of the tree saved. only trees with a dbh measurement of four (4) inches or greater and spaced appropriately for future growth shall be eligible for tree credit. tree credit shall only be given to trees with main trunks located on the development site. no tree credits shall be applied toward meeting the tree inches allocated to the street frontage and residential buffers unless the trees are located in these buffer areas. if during construction trees that are shown on the landscape plan to be preserved are cleared or removed then replacement trees shall be required equal to the total inches of credit given for the trees in accordance with this section. section 424. specimen trees or stands of trees. when making a determination on the identification of specimen trees the following standards shall be adhered to: a. any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: (1) large hardwood trees: 24-inch dbh or larger such as oaks hickories poplars etc. (2) large coniferous trees: 30-inch dbh or larger such as pines cedars etc. (3) understory trees: 4-inch dbh or larger such as dogwoods redbuds sourwoods etc. b. a tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum health standards: (1) a life expectancy of greater than 15 years. (2) a structurally sound trunk not hollow and having no extensive decay and less than 20% radial trunk dieback. (3) no more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). (4) no major insect or pathological problem. c. a tree of a lesser-size than specified in this section can be considered a specimen tree if it is: (1) a rare or unusual species of exceptional or unique quality or of historical significance. (2) specifically used by a builder developer or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project. (3) a contiguous grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the city. determination is based upon the following criteria: (a) a relatively mature even-aged stand. (b) a stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature. (c) a stand of historical significance. (d) a stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. iv-59 in order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects additional credit will be given for specimen trees which meet the standards outlined in section 428. in addition the specimen tree must be successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. credit for any specimen tree thus saved shall be twice the normal credit. section 425. tree protection. 425.01. purpose. the purpose of this section shall be to establish methods of protecting trees and their root systems during the land development process. 425.02. methods of tree protection. root space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the land development process. the root system of trees easily goes beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. disturbances within the critical root zone can directly affect a tree s chances for survival. to protect the root zone the following methods are suggested: a. tree protection area   a tree protection area for all trees within the r.o.w. and any trees proposed to remain within 25 feet of any proposed grading clearing tree removal or construction shall be established by physical barriers prior to any land disturbance and maintained until such work is completed. all tree protection areas shall be defined by at least a concentric circle centering on the trunk with a radius equal in feet to the number of inches of the tree s diameter at breast height. in no cases shall the radius be less than 8 feet. example: a 12  dbh tree would have a 12  radius (24 diameter) tree protection area. b. protective barriers   protective tree fencing shall be installed at the edge of the tree protection area prior to any land disturbance. where feasible fencing should extend beyond the drip line of the trees being protected. fencing shall be a minimum of 4 feet in height consisting of orange polyethylene laminar or chain link fabric secured with metal t-posts or other means approved by the city arborist. c. signage   the placement of  tree protection  and/or  keep out  signage shall be attached to the physical barrier at all times. the location and quantity of signage shall be on all sides and convey the intent of the tree protection area and barriers. d. construction activity   construction activities (such as grading parking storing equipment or materials trenching digging washing or rinsing etc.) shall not be allowed within the tree protection area. utilities irrigation lines or any underground fixture shall be routed around the tree protection areas. necessary installation through the tree protection areas shall be accomplished by boring under the root system at a minimum depth of 24 inches. e. other acceptable best management practices (bmps) for tree protection (see bmps for trees found in the appendix). section 426. plant materials. sections 426 and 426.01 specify the plant materials and standards that must be met in order to satisfy the requirements of sections 420 through 421 (bufferyards) 422 through 422.03 (general landscaping) 422.04 (off-street parking) and 707 (nonconforming bufferyards). 426.01. plant material specifications. a plant materials matrix designating the breakdown of the tree types (appendix a of this ordinance) shall be used to determine which plant materials may be used to satisfy the requirements of this ordinance under specified conditions. any variation from plantings in appendix a will be reviewed by the planning department staff in conjunction with consultation with the city arborist. the vertical axis of the matrix classifies plant materials by type: canopy trees understory trees evergreen trees deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs. these plant types correspond to the plant types specified by the sections of this ordinance which require planting. iv-60 it shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or property owner to select species from appendix a that are appropriate to the locations in which they will be planted and to maintain them so as to meet the intent of this ordinance. all plant materials shall meet minimum standards of caliper fullness of form height root ball and vigor as described by the american association of nurserymen standards published in the current edition of american standards for nursery stock. in the event of inclement weather or mitigating circumstances landscape material may be bonded in accordance with procedures established by the city of auburn planning department. 426.02. minimum plant size. unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this ordinance all plant materials shall meet the following minimum size standards: minimum plant size and type plant material type all plantings canopy tree single stem 2 to 2   inch caliper and 12  height multi-stem clump 25 gallon and 8  height evergreen canopy 25 gallon and 6  height understory tree single stem 15 gallon and 6  height multi-stem clump 15 gallon and 6  height shrub 3 gallon and 18 inches high ground cover 1 gallon and 6 inches high notes: unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this ordinance all plant materials shall meet the following minimum size standards: all plants should meet american standards for nursery stock (ansi z60.1-1996). all minimum height requirements listed shall be planted height. balled and burlap or field grown materials that meet caliper and height requirements and ansi standards are acceptable. no more than 50% combined may be crepe myrtle and/or bradford pear in any landscape. section 427. minimum planting areas. in order to provide sufficient growing areas for planted urban trees the following minimum planting areas are recommended: 1. canopy trees   304 square feet of pervious root zone 2. understory trees   90 square feet of pervious root zone section 428. landscape plan submission requirements. in the interest of improving the landscape design approval installation and inspection process landscape plans shall be required as part of the site plan approval process. if tree credits are desired the landscape plan shall consist of a three phase plan: a tree survey plan (section 428.a) a tree protection plan (section 428.b) and a tree replacement plan (section 428.c). if tree credits are not desired the landscape plan shall consist solely of the tree replacement plan (section 428.c). a preliminary landscape plan showing bufferyard widths and items 2 and 3 from the tree replacement plan is required with the development review team (drt) submittal. unless otherwise stated the final landscape plan shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit. order of submittal: prior to issuance of a clearing and grubbing permit: 1. tree survey plan 2. tree protection plan iv-61 with development review team (drt) submittal a plan showing: 1. bufferyard widths 2. an outline of the parking area used for calculating 10% of the parking area if using option 2. 3. the size of the landscape islands planter strips and peninsulas (if applicable) and their distances from the nearest planted areas. prior to issuance of a building permit: 1. tree replacement plan a. the tree survey plan. the tree survey plan shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan noting the following information: (1) a survey plan showing all trees including specimen trees and specimen stands of trees that shall be preserved and shall count toward meeting the tree inches requirements. the plan shall indicate the location size and species of all trees to be preserved. only trees with a dbh of four (4) inches or greater are eligible for tree credit and shall be inventoried. (2) sampling methods may be used to determine inventory data for forested areas over two acres. (3) all critical root zones must be shown on the survey. the critical root zone will typically be represented by a concentric circle entering on the tree s trunk with a radius equal in feet to one (1) times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. b. the tree protection plan. the tree protection plan is a detailed plan designed to protect and preserve trees before during and for a period of two years after construction. the tree survey and the tree protection plans shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a clearing and grubbing permit preferably with the engineering certificate. the plan shall include the following specifications: (1) the location size species and critical root zone of all trees to be preserved on site or within the r.o.w. (2) all tree protection areas and methods of protection including but not limited to tree fencing retaining walls signage etc.  details of all permanent tree protection methods.

the height of the proposed building by the angle of light exposure factor for the zoning district as shown below: district angle of light exposure factor ddh 1.0 mdrd 0.5 nrd 0.75 r 1.0 rdd 1.0 ldd 1.0 cdd 1.0 sccd 1.0 v-23 the product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the property line. if based on this calculation the setback required is greater than the minimum width of the required bufferyard the setback according to the angle of light exposure factor must be used. also note that the setback required by this calculation may further restrict the setback requirements of section 502.02 for performance housing types. in all cases the most restrictive setback requirement must be used. this section shall not apply to conventional subdivisions in any district. b. maximum setbacks. where lots have double frontage the maximum setback shall apply to the frontage upon any designated corridor (section 429). for corner properties the maximum setback shall be measured from the property line of both rights-of-way. this setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements. recessed portions of any proposed structure designed for outdoor seating dining or events shall be allowed under the requirements of this section following the review and approval of the planning commission. such recesses shall be clearly illustrated on the site plan. c. building setback and height requirements for the industrial district. setbacks (ft) building height zoning district front rear total side minimum side1 side yard on street maximum

core (uc) district see section 507. for building setbacks in the college edge overlay district (ceod) see section 508. for building setbacks in the urban neighborhood (un-e un-w and un-s) districts see section 509. section 504. planned developments. a planned development is intended to encourage flexibility in siting mixtures of housing types and land uses open space and the preservation of significant natural features. the goal is a development in which buildings land use transportation facilities utility systems and open spaces are integrated through an overall design. a planned development shall be permitted in a planned development district (pdd) overlay district. the pdd overlay district is an additional zoning requirement that is placed on a geographic area already zoned. the pdd designation can be requested and considered only for properties already zoned as ddh mdrd cdd ldd nrd rdd crd and sccd. property receiving a pdd designation shall be subject to the provisions of both the base zoning district and the pdd. the base zone which is the underlying zone shall regulate the lot area setback bulk regulations parking the maximum far and isr maximum gross density and the minimum open space ratio for performance residential uses  and the minimum site area and lot width for nonresidential uses. the pdd overlay zone shall regulate the permitted and conditional uses allowed  the mixed use development components  and the maximum percentage of allowable dwelling units in a mixed commercial/residential development. where provisions of the pdd and the zoning districts are in conflict the provisions of the pdd shall govern. v-24 504.01. minimum size and ownership. a planned development shall consist of a minimum of ten (10) acres. at the time of the application for pdd zoning the entire tract of land for which rezoning is requested shall be under unified control of a single individual partnership or corporation. 504.02. uses permitted on

of: 1) any commercial uses permitted in this district as set forth in sections 402 and 408 of this ordinance and 2) one or more dwelling units on the same development as the commercial uses. a master development plan shall be required in connection with any request for pdd zoning. 504.03. connection between uses and adjoining development. connection between mixed use and residential areas is required in order to provide cohesiveness in the overall development site. cohesiveness shall be provided through connectedness of land uses streets utilities pedestrian and bicycle paths greenways and signage. the design of any planned development or mixed use development should reflect effort by the developer to plan land uses so as to blend harmoniously not only within the development site but with adjacent land uses to ensure compatibility cohesiveness and connectivity. 504.04. changes to zoning ordinance. no amendments to this zoning ordinance relative to planned development shall be effective to any pdd approval issued prior to such amendment it being intended that the pdd shall continue to be developed in accordance with the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of such prior approval. (amendments dated 5/02/06 pursuant to ordinance number 2389) 504.05. development incentives. development incentives shall be provided to developers of qualified planned development upon the written request. incentive is the granting by the approving authority of additional development capacity in exchange for a public benefit or amenity. providing incentives is not just beneficial for the developer but to adjacent development and the public. the need for incentives will vary for different planned developments. therefore the allocation of incentives shall be determined on a case-bycase basis. incentives may include any of the following: incentive density bonus: 10% increase in base zone density. density bonus: 20% increase in base zone density floor area ratio: an increase in the floor area ratio (far) for individual performance single-family residential lots not to exceed 20% above the allowable far. reduced setbacks: reduction in front and side setback requirements for single-family residential uses as long as the minimum front yard setback is at least ten (10) feet and no porch encroaches into this 10-foot front setback. the side yards shall not be less than five feet. the request for setback incentives shall not result in encroachment of any structures into a required landscaped bufferyard stream buffer or other environmentally sensitive areas. v-25 reduction in minimum lot width: a reduction up to 20% in the minimum lot width for single-family detached and zero lot line residential lots. no reduction shall be allowed for lots located in a cul-de-sac or along the curvature of a street. master signage plan approval: to expedite the sign permitting process a master sign plan can be submitted depicting all proposed signage in accordance with section 606 for the planned development. flexibility may be granted by the planning director in the number size location and height of the signs. once approved no signs shall be erected on the site except as shown on the approved master signage plan. a master development plan may be amended by filing a new plan. accelerated preliminary plat approval process: to expedite the approval process preliminary plats for residential developments shall be approved administratively by staff. this incentive shall be contingent upon findings by the staff that the preliminary plats are consistent with the approved master development plan. a public hearing for the preliminary plat will be held in conjunction with the public hearing for the pdd/master development plan approval process. in this case the master development plan will be referred to as the preliminary master development plan. a preliminary master development plan shall be required to contain more detailed information relative to the lot size and lot width of each residential lot. increase in isr: an increase in the impervious surface ratio (isr) for residential uses not to exceed 20% above the allowable isr. this incentive is not applicable to developments in the lake ogletree/martin- marietta watersheds and any areas zoned for conservation subdivisions. the exchange for this incentive is predetermined. see asterisk under exchange. exchange open space improvements: improvements to greenway/open space such as pedestrian paths bike trails and street lighting along pedestrian paths and bike trails. improvements must be approved by the planning director and the parks and recreation director. housing for the elderly and/or low and moderate income: provision of housing qualifying as elderly housing or low and moderate income families in accordance with federal guidelines (see economic development). vegetated buffer along the perimeter: a 20-foot wide undisturbed natural or landscaped buffer along the perimeter of the development site. an undisturbed natural buffer/open space is an unimproved area that has retained its natural character of trees shrubs and ground covering. a landscaped buffer must meet the standards for residential buffer landscaping requirements as cited in section 422.03 of this ordinance. increased open space: a 25% increase in open space beyond the minimum required open space for the development site (required acreage of open space x 25%). the additional open space shall be comprised of undisturbed natural open space. vegetated buffers along the perimeter cannot count toward the increased open space requirement. in addition stream buffers utility easements and other easements required by the city of auburn shall not count as open space under this incentive. moreover this exchange can be offered twice for two incentives. for example a developer can offer a 50% increase over the minimum required open space for his development site in exchange for two incentives of his choice. park and recreation areas: a minimum of five acres of useable park space to be developed and maintained primarily for both active and passive recreational pursuits including but not limited to tot-lots playgrounds neighborhood parks and play fields. these five acres can be dispersed throughout the development site as long as the total acreage of park and recreational areas is equivalent to five acres. improvements shall not be permitted in the increased open space cited above but shall be permitted on the land allocated to meet the minimum open space requirement under the base zone designation. proposed improvements must be approved by the planning director and parks and recreation director. this exchange cannot be offered in conjunction with the open space improvement unless approved by the director of parks and v-26 recreation. the parks and recreation areas must be owned and maintained by the developer and/or a homeowners  association. parking in the rear for multi-family: parking for multi-family development shall be located in the rear of the buildings. parking in the rear for commercial/office use: parking for commercial and office developments shall be located in the rear of the buildings. limited access: access to single-family attached and detached dwellings shall be provided from alleys and/or shared driveways. low density along the edge: lower density residential development along the perimeter of the development site or adjacent to existing single-family residential development on adjoining properties. for the purpose of this exchange lower density residential is defined as a minimum lot area of 10000 square feet. dedicated open space: land allocated and dedicated to the city for future parks and public greenways in accordance with the city s greenway/future park plan. the land must be dedicated after the pdd rezoning is approved by the city council and prior to the first preliminary plat submission. no request for an incentive shall be accepted unless an exchange is offered. an exchange is a public benefit or amenity provided by an applicant or developer for additional development capacity. the developer shall have the option of choosing from the list the exchange to offer for the incentive. a planned development shall be allowed only two development incentives. the entire area shown on a master development plan shall constitute a planned development site for the purpose of allocating incentives and exchanges. requests for incentives and the reasons therefore shall be set forth by the applicant in the application for pdd approval. the applicant shall explain in his request how each incentive would benefit and not be detrimental to the public interest. the benefits derived from the exchange may not necessarily impact the development itself. no incentives may be allowed when the proposed modification would result in: (1) traffic volume exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity of the planned development. (2) an undue burden on community facilities such as schools fire and police protection utilities and other such facilities. (3) detrimental impact on surrounding land uses. (4) incompatibility with the goals of the land use plan. (5) negative impact on the local watersheds. staff will review each request for incentive as requested and address the above findings in the staff report. the burden of proof that these criteria are not being violated shall rest with the applicant and not the staff. development incentives if granted shall supersede the applicable regulations of the base and pdd zoning districts of the planned development. all incentives requested and exchanges offered relative to density bonuses minimum lot width open space perimeter buffer parking and low density must be reflected on the proposed master development plan as v-27 presented to the planning commission or city council for approval. incentives shall become a component of the master development plan and shall be binding upon all future

development and continued existence of legal uses structures lots and signs established either prior to the effective date of this ordinance or the effective date of future amendments to this ordinance that no longer conform to the requirements of this ordinance. all such situations are collectively referred to as nonconformities. the zoning regulations established by this ordinance are designed to guide the future use of land in the city of auburn by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare. the continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such regulations are established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable. with limited exceptions the regulations of this article permit such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time but are intended to restrict further investments which would make them more permanent. while nonconformities may continue the provisions of this chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities to bring about their eventual improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this ordinance and the character of the city. any nonconforming use structure lot or sign that lawfully existed as of the effective date of this ordinance and that remains nonconforming and any use structure lot or sign that becomes nonconforming as a result of any subsequent rezoning or amendment to the text of this ordinance may be continued or maintained only in accordance with the terms of this chapter. this chapter also is intended to reduce vacancies promote appropriate redevelopment and reuse of existing structures and lots and set forth requirements. this article distinguishes nonconforming uses nonconforming structures nonconforming development sites nonconforming lots of record nonconforming manufactured home parks and nonconforming signs. different regulations are made applicable to each of these categories. the degree of restriction made applicable to each separate category is a function of the degree to which that category of nonconformity is a nuisance or incompatible with the purposes and regulations of this ordinance. section 701. definitions. 701.01. a legal nonconformity is any land use or physical design of development structure sign or lot of record legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment to it which would not be permitted by or is not in full compliance with the regulations of this ordinance. 701.02. a nonconforming use is an activity using land buildings and/or structures for purposes which were legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment to it and which would not be permitted to be established as a new use in a zone in which it is located by the regulations of this ordinance. once changed to a conforming use no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. 701.03. a nonconforming structure is any building or structure other than a sign legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment to it which does not fully comply with the standards of this ordinance. 701.04. a

plat at the time of its establishment which does not fully comply with the standards of this ordinance including the minimum acceptable bufferyard requirements of section 714. noncompliance with the bufferyard requirements of section 420 through section 432 requires compliance with section 714 but does not render a development site nonconforming. 701.05. a nonconforming lot of record is any validly recorded lot meeting the requirements of   711.03 of the zoning ordinance which at the time it was recorded fully complied with all applicable laws and ordinances but which does not fully

actions that do not meet the provisions of section 705 or section 706. vii-2 704.04. enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in section 708 of this ordinance and also the requirements of this section. 704.05. site plans site plans may be required for activities falling under the provisions of section 704.2. site plans shall be required for activities falling under the provisions of section 704.03 and section 704.04 section 705. continuation maintenance and minor repair. 705.01. the continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a nonconforming use are permitted provided that the continuation maintenance or minor repair does not extend or expand the nonconforming use or structure except in accordance with section 705. for the purposes of this section maintenance or minor repair shall mean: a. repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure b. maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses  and c. repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety as determined by the codes enforcement division (does not apply to damage or destruction governed by section 703.01). c. incidental alterations (see section 203) including: a. internal

reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or conforming structure on a nonconforming site shall not be required to acquire conditional use approval or undergo the typical drt review procedure if the eligibility requirements of section 706.03 below are met. owners of such properties may be issued a zoning certificate after staff review of the proposed reuse or redevelopment. reuse and redevelopment that does not qualify for consideration under this section may instead utilize the process in section 707 for review and approval. 706.02. intent. the intent of this process is to encourage the utilization of existing nonconforming buildings and sites as opposed to their remaining vacant while at the same time reducing such nonconformities to the extent practical. the process allows owners to make improvements to an existing structure or site without having to go through a lengthy review process produce a detailed site plan reach compliance with all provisions of this ordinance or make roadway improvements. vii-3 706.03 eligibility requirements to qualify for issuance of a zoning certificate under section 706 the following conditions must exist: 1. the proposed use is permitted within the zoning district. 2. the redeveloped use will occupy an existing building(s) on the site with no expansions or additions proposed. 3. the site will add no more than 1000 square feet of additional impervious surface. 4. the proposed new use does not expand existing encroachments into required buffers. 5. the site will be in compliance with the provisions of article vi signs. 706.04 limitations proposals which do not meet the eligibility requirements of section 706.03 are required to undergo the normal drt review process and/or the conditional use process in cases of expansion or major alteration. proposals for nonconforming sites or structures that have been vacant for less than twelve (12) months and do not involve either proposed or required any changes to the site or exterior of the structure (changes listed under section 705 are exempted) shall be reviewed during the zoning certificate issuance process for compliance with the approved site plan or ordinance requirements in effect at the time it was established. if one (1) or more aspects of the site and/or structure fail to comply with the applicable plan approval or ordinance requirements the deficiencies shall be corrected and the planning director must verify compliance prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. proposals involving a change in use that although may be permitted within the underlying zoning district will increase the intensity of the use(s) originally approved will be required to demonstrate compliance with the current ordinance requirements applicable to the proposed change prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate and/or certificate of occupancy. demonstrating compliance can be accomplished either through the site plan review or section 706 process whichever is applicable. 706.05. plan submittal requirements issuance of a zoning certificate under this section may require submission of the following information upon request of staff: 1. landscaping and/or fencing compliant with section 714 minimum acceptable bufferyards  and 2. off-street parking/parking lot design (dimensional standards and standard specifications)  and 3. screening of dumpsters storage heating and air conditioning and similar equipment  and 4. building improvements (painting or other changes)  and 5. access roads and entrances or exit drives to ensure automotive

those conditions as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems or to bring the nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and the general public. 706.07. exceptions for required improvements the director of planning and/or the public works director may waive in part or in full certain required improvements if meeting them is deemed impractical or unreasonable given the constraints on the existing site. consideration may also be given to the extent of the required improvements in relation to the specific nature and scope of the reuse/redevelopment proposal. section 707. administrative review and approval. enlargement expansion alteration or major repair of a nonconforming structure use or site shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section. vii-4 707.01. site plans as required in section 704.05 shall be submitted for review by the planning director or his designee. site plans must meet the requirements of section 802.12 of this ordinance. the planning director or his designee shall determine whether to approve the proposed enlargement expansion alteration or major repair. the planning director or his designee shall not approve the proposed activity unless and until it is found based on the submitted site plan that the proposed enlargement expansion alteration or major repair meets the standards of review set forth in section 802.05 review procedures of this ordinance as well as the following: 1. the nonconforming use allowed to continue remains compatible with adjacent land uses and the future land use plan 2. that all access roads and entrance or exit drives to the nonconformity will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience traffic flow and control and access in the case of fire or other emergency 3. that all off-street parking loading refuse collection and other service areas will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience traffic flow and economic noise glare odor and other impacts on adjoining properties 4. that all water wastewater treatment schools fire and police protection and other necessary public and private utilities and services will be adequate with respect to their location availability and compatibility with adjoining properties 5. that all landscaping screening and fencing will be adequate with respect to the effectiveness of their type dimensions and character will be adequate with respect to minimizing the economic noise glare odor and other impacts of the nonconformity on adjoining properties and other properties in the neighborhood 6. that the type size and intensity of the proposed use including such considerations as storage of items and arrangement the size of the site and the location of the use upon it and the hours of operation and numbers of people who are likely to utilize or be attached to the use will be adequate with respect to minimizing the impact of the nonconformity upon adjoining properties other properties in the neighborhood and the purposes of the zoning district in which the property is located  and 7. surface drainage will be adequate with respect to on-site and off-site erosion siltation pollution flooding or other detrimental effects of the nonconformity. 707.02. other considerations in determining whether the proposed extension alteration or major repair will substantially injure the use and enjoyment of other properties the planning director or his designee shall also consider and balance: 1. the possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the nonconformity resulting from denying the approval from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance or from approving the request 2. the possible detriment or benefit to the owners of nearby properties resulting from denying the approval from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance or from approving the request  and 3. the possible detriment or benefit to the general public resulting from denying the approval from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance or from approving the request. 707.03. conditions the planning director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request including appropriate time limits for meeting those conditions as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems or to bring the nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby

the area of such expansion shall not exceed 25 percent of the area of the existing nonconforming use or structure unless otherwise allowable in this section 2. telecommunications towers may be expanded by more than 25 percent to permit the co-location of a second or subsequent user or communications sending or receiving device so that the need for an additional tower is eliminated. only the city council may permit the expansion of a non-conforming telecommunications tower in districts in which it is not a permitted use. 707.05 limits on requirements in acting upon applications submitted under section 707 the planning director or his designee shall not order the discontinuation or termination of nonconformity. if an application is denied then the continuation maintenance and minor repair of the nonconformity shall still be allowed in accordance with the terms of this article. section 708. enlargement or expansion of conditional uses. enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section. 708.01. process for approval the process for conditional use approval shall be in two parts: 1. approval of the conditional use shall be in accordance with the requirements of section 803 of this ordinance requiring planning commission review and city council approval. 2. approval of the enlargement expansion alteration or major repair of a nonconforming structure use or site shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth section 707 section 709. exceptions for residential setbacks certain additions to existing nonconforming single- two- three- or multi-family or townhouse dwellings may extend into a required front side or rear yard setback when the existing dwelling is already legally nonconforming with respect to that setback. the nonconforming portion shall be at least 60 percent of the total width of the respective wall of the structure prior to the addition. additions may extend up to the height limit of the zoning district and extend into the required front side and/or rear yard setback as follows: 1. front and rear yard setbacks: the addition may extend five feet into the required front or rear yard setback or to the extent of the setback line formed by the nonconforming portion whichever is less. 2. side yard setbacks: the addition may extend into the required side yard setback up to the setback line formed by the nonconforming wall except in no case shall the addition be closer than 5 feet from the side property line. furthermore the size of the addition shall be limited to an additional wall surface area within the required side setback area of no more than 200 square feet. section 710. exceptions for historic resources in an effort to promote and encourage the preservation and adaptive reuse of locally designated resources the planning director or his designee may grant certain waivers to the zoning code provided that it will result in the preservation of a locally designated property after review and approval by the historic preservation commission. the planning director or his designee may authorize certain waivers to the requirements of the underlying zoning district to the extent indicated herein. vii-6 1. any building that is individually locally designated or is classified as a contributing building within a local historic district as identified in the contributing resources report shall be permitted to be repaired restored structurally altered or reconstructed notwithstanding any conflicts with provisions of the underlying zoning district requirements pertaining to minimum lot size setbacks minimum lot width far open space off-street parking or loading requirements. in cases where the configuration of a locally designated property or a contributing property within a locally designated historic district precludes reasonable and appropriate use of the property within the underlying zoning district a waiver of up to twenty percent (20%) from the underlying requirements for setbacks far and open space may be authorized by the planning director or his designee. 2. any contributing historic resource or building will not be limited to the valuation clause for nonconformities. 3. in cases where the size or configuration of a locally designated property or a contributing property within a locally designated historic district is such that compliance with off-street parking requirements would destroy the historic character of the property the planning director or his designee may authorize a reduction of up to one hundred percent (100%) of the number of parking spaces that would ordinarily be required for a new structure of equivalent use and floor area. such a reduction will be granted only when it can be demonstrated that: a. granting the modification will further the preservation of the historic and architectural character of the historic resource or of the historic district in which the proposal is located. b. granting the modification would promote the preservation of the historic resource or historic district while reducing nonconformities. c. granting the modification would help minimize or mitigate any potential adverse effect of a specific proposal whose implementation promotes the preservation of the historic resource or historic district. d. special circumstances exist such as adjacencies or shared parking that will practically alleviate concerns for off-street parking. the planning director or his designee shall make specific findings that establish how the criteria have been met. additionally staff may impose any conditions restrictions or limitations deemed appropriate in order to ensure compliance with the criteria set forth above. section 711. nonconforming lots of record. 711.01. subject to the provisions of this section a nonconforming lot of record may be used for any principal use permitted or conditional provided approval from city council in the zone in which the lot is located provided that for any use which is to be served by an individual well and/or septic system the nonconforming lot shall be of a size and design to meet the minimum requirements of the lee county health department regulations for such wells and septic systems. 711.02. performance residential developments shall be prohibited on development sites smaller than the minimum sizes established in section 502.02. if permitted in the applicable zoning district single family dwelling units may be constructed on nonconforming lots of record at least 4000 square feet in size and 50 feet in width. adjoining lots which are combined to form one (1) parcel shall be considered to meet this standard. 711.03. minimum lot sizes for nonresidential uses are established in table 4-3. to qualify as a nonconforming lot of record under this section lots must have been platted prior to or in the year 1984 or be smaller than the following sizes: rural district (r) 40000 s.f. industrial district (i) 10000 s.f. other districts1 7500 s.f. in addition to the requirements of the previous sentence a nonconforming lot must be have fully complied with all applicable laws and ordinances at the time it was recorded but currently does not fully comply with the lot requirements of this ordinance concerning minimum area minimum lot width or minimum street frontage. where a lot meets the required minimum size for the district but not for a particular use category as specified in table 4-3 (i.e. road service use 1however no minimum lot size is required in the urban core (uc) district. vii-7 requires 30000 s.f.) it shall not be considered a nonconforming lot of record. the lot shall instead be used for another development type for which it is eligible based on its size. property which qualifies as a nonconforming lot of record under this section shall be eligible for any land use category having a minimum size requirement of 40000 s.f. in the rural (r) district 10000 square feet in the industrial (i) district and 7500 s.f. in all others as established in table 4-3. 711.04. no nonresidential use(s) shall be permitted on nonconforming lots of record less than 6000 square feet in size and 60 feet in width unless the board of zoning adjustment grants a variance. variances granted under this section shall not be use specific but rather granted for the required lot size and width for a particular use. section 712. nonconforming uses in the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a one (1) year period or more or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure or premises is located the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such structure or premise is located. 712.01. change of use any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use by securing all approvals and permits that this ordinance requires for the intended or resulting use. no nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use. section 713. manufactured home parks 713.01. existing manufactured home parks which are nonconforming by use shall not be redesigned expanded in area or modified to accommodate additional manufactured homes. 713.02. manufactured home parks which are properly zoned and which are nonconforming by design only may be expanded in area and/or modified so as to reduce or eliminate those aspects of design which render it nonconforming. the planning commission may authorize additional manufactured home sites in such parks upon submission of a site plan consistent with the standards of section 802 showing a redesign of the park which substantiates the following: a. the overall density of the park will not exceed seven (7) units per acre. b. a 20-foot wide residential buffer shall be provided along all development site boundaries (see section 426.03 residential buffer landscaping requirements). c. no new manufactured home will be placed within 20 feet of any property line. d. where possible all development standards of section 502.02(g) have been met or the degree of nonconformity reduced. in no case shall the degree of nonconformity of any design aspect be increased. a redesign proposal that does not include the addition of new manufactured home spaces shall not be subject to conditions a and b above. any redesign proposal shall be subject to review and approval by the city engineer. 713.03. the replacement of an existing manufactured home shall be allowed provided that such replacement does not increase any degree of existing nonconformity (e.g. setbacks). vii-8 section 714. minimum acceptable bufferyard. subsequent to the discontinuance of a nonconforming use a development site which is nonconforming by physical design may be utilized for any activity or use which is otherwise permitted by this ordinance. however as a condition of approval of any enlargement reconfiguration or any type of new development on the site certain improvements must be made pursuant to this section. when nonconformity is a result of noncompliance with the bufferyard required by article iv of this ordinance and the subject property is physically unable because of its limited land area to meet normal bufferyard requirements the following requirements shall be met: a. in no case shall bufferyard requirements less than those provided in figure 7-1 be applied to the site. b. where an anchor tenant (40000 square feet of gross floor area or larger) of a shopping center has been replaced full compliance with the bufferyard requirements of article iv shall result. when such alterations shall result in a nonconformity with the provisions of this ordinance (i.e. required parking) or an increase in an already nonconforming aspect of the ordinance the site shall conform to subsection a above. c. if in the judgment of the planning director and city engineer subsection b cannot be met then upon evaluation of the size and other relevant characteristics of a site bufferyard width and planting requirements may be prorated as appropriate in consultation with the planning commission. section 715. nonconforming signs. a nonconforming sign is any sign within the jurisdiction of the zoning ordinance of the city of auburn on the effective date of this article or any sign existing within any area annexed into such jurisdiction after the effective date of this article which is prohibited by or does not conform to the requirements of article vi of this ordinance. nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition. however such signs shall: a. not be structurally altered to accommodate another nonconforming sign or sign face b. not be structurally altered in order to

subdivisions shall be consistent with applicable sections of this ordinance. section 802. site plans. 802.01. intent and purpose. this section shall apply to all site plans as defined in article ii. the site plan procedures shall be required in order to ensure that site-specific development projects meet the requirements of this ordinance prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate authorizing a building permit. it is the intent of this section that the site plan review process be a part of the building permit application process and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the site will be constructed and inspected prior to occupancy of the development. 802.02. development requiring site plan approval. prior to issuance of a zoning certificate site plan approval shall be required for all proposed non-residential construction as well as residential development types described in sections 502.02 (f) (g) and (h). this shall include clubhouses or other ancillary facilities within a residential subdivision. site plan approval shall also be required for the subdivision of an existing development site of a type subject to site plan requirements and/or an expansion reduction or reconfiguration of any such development type. for any proposal in which these requirements are unclear the planning director shall determine whether site plan approval is necessary. 802.03. review of site plans. site plans submitted for review shall be approved disapproved or referred to the planning commission. site plan review shall be in accordance with section 1.0   general information of the auburn public works design and construction manual. in approving a site plan any request for waivers from the requirements of this ordinance shall be taken to the planning commission for consideration as provided in section 802.04. the following criteria shall be used in determining whether to approve a site plan: a. completeness of application information as required under section 802.12 b. consistency with adopted policies and standards of the major streets and utilities master plans c. uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this ordinance d. whether the site plan meets applicable design standards established by this ordinance viii-1 e. availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development such as roads sewer water schools solid waste disposal and fire protection (including access to the site for emergency vehicles)  and f. compatibility with surrounding land uses (this criterion shall apply only where a site plan proposes a conditional use pursuant to section 803). the planning director and/or city engineer may refer any site plan proposal to the planning commission. 802.04. waiver of selected development standards   approval by planning commission. specific development standards that may be modified with planning commission approval are limited to the following: bufferyards including width planting and required structures  and general and off-street parking landscaping requirements. this may be done only upon a specific finding by the planning commission that such requirements are inappropriate as applied to a particular development site due to its size proposed use and/or location and that a waiver would not conflict with the intent of this ordinance or confer upon any property owner a right or privilege denied to neighboring property owners within the same district. 802.05. review procedures. site plan applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the planning director and staff prior to formal submission of a site plan for review. at the applicant s request a preapplication conference shall be held at which time planning staff members will provide the applicant with advice and guidance regarding the requirements of this ordinance and any other regulations which apply. preliminary sketches shall be reviewed and overall development concepts finalized at this time. it shall be the applicant s responsibility to request the pre-application conference and any other available guidance in sufficient time to prepare a complete application package. site plan submittals shall be in accordance with section 1.0   general information of the auburn public works design and construction manual. a. site plan preparation requirements. where the proposed development site is three (3) acres in size or larger the site plan shall be prepared and sealed by an architect professional engineer or surveyor. at the planning directors discretion the same requirement may be applied to sites of less than three (3) acres where the plan proposes high-intensity uses or activities that may have a substantial impact on surrounding properties. sketch plans and drawings submitted with variance or other zoning-related applications shall not be accepted for review as a site plan unless they are prepared in accordance with the guidelines of this section and contain all required information. in all cases engineering plans addressing drainage road construction and other technical aspects of development design shall be sealed by a civil engineer registered in the state of alabama. b. development site requirements. for development sites of one (1) acre or more full engineering drawings or a project engineer s statement must be submitted by an engineer registered in the state of alabama. the city engineer may choose to require additional information as necessary. c. completeness of plans. site plans submitted without complete information in accordance with section 802.12 shall not be reviewed by the planning staff or placed on the planning commission agenda. d. staff review. the planning director and other appropriate city staff members shall review the site plan with specific regard to this ordinance and other regulations of the city of auburn. the staff review shall identify matters of development policy concern to which the applicant shall address particular attention. viii-2 e. revised plans. following submission of a complete application package for site plan review the planning staff shall have 15 working days in which to complete the review and approve the site plan. for site plans that must go before the planning commission at such time as the planning commission determines that all staff comments have been adequately addressed and that the requirements of all applicable city state and federal regulations have been met it shall approve the site plan. 802.06. approval of site plans. except as stipulated in section 802.04 no site plan shall be approved which is inconsistent with any term contained in this ordinance unless a variance has been authorized in accordance with section 907 of this ordinance. 802.07. effect of site plan approval. approved site plans shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval and a zoning certificate and building permit for the development may be obtained during that time period. the planning director may make an extension of site plan approval for a single period up to six (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire. an extension may be granted only if the planning director concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application. all such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 days before the expiration of the approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension request. requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. instead the applicant shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this section. upon approval of the site plan the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction drawings to the engineering and codes enforcement divisions for permitting. these shall include but are not limited to detailed building plans grading plans drainage and stormwater management facilities erosion control plans road and driveway construction specifications and tree removal plans. nothing contained herein shall preclude the codes enforcement division from accepting for review and processing building construction plans related to the structural mechanical electrical and plumbing systems prior to final approval of a site plan subject to such conditions as may be established by that department relative to processing of site plans prior to final approval. in such instances no building permit will be issued until the planning department has issued a zoning certificate and the site plan has been stamped approved and is on file in the office of the codes enforcement division. all building and construction permits issued for any project requiring site plan review shall be consistent with the stamped approved site plan. the approval of a site plan shall not under any circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the applicable city requirements for construction or installation of structures or materials. whenever a conflict between the site plan and such construction details occurs the more restrictive or that requiring the higher standard shall prevail. 802.08. modification or termination of site plans. a. site plan amendments. after final approval any modification variation or adjustment of a stamped approved site plan shall require approval of a site plan amendment. upon approval of any amendment the planning director or his/her designee shall stamp and date the most recent version of the site plan showing the approved amendment and mark all previous copies as  void . if appropriate the engineering and codes enforcement divisions shall be notified of the amendment. b. site plan expiration and cancellation. in the event of a change to these regulations the site plan shall be valid under the regulations for which it was approved for 18 months from the date of such approval. upon expiration of the site plan and any extension that viii-3 may have been granted the planning director shall make appropriate records in the planning department files stamp all available copies of the site plan as  void  and notify the engineering and codes enforcement divisions of the expiration. the applicant may cancel the site plan at any time between the date of final approval and the date of expiration by submitting a written request to the planning director. upon receipt of this request by the planning director the site plan shall be treated as expired. 802.09. integration of other review procedures. any site plan to be built in stages or requiring variance or conditional use approval shall be coordinated as set forth below: a. development built in stages. as part of the application for site plan approval the developer shall submit a proposed staging of development plan including a schedule for completion of all improvements pursuant to section 504.02. if the site plan proposes any of the performance residential housing types described in section 502.02 (a) through (g) a master development plan pursuant to section 504 shall also be required. once a site plan for a stage has been approved no land may be used and no building may be occupied except in accordance with such plan. a new site plan is required for each successive stage of the development. stage configurations shall be logical and consistent with the purposes of this ordinance. if appropriate the planning director may stipulate that any or all portions of the required landscaping and/or bufferyards be provided during the first stage of development even though some bufferyards or portions thereof lie outside the stage. each stage at a minimum must include adequate parking drainage facilities landscaping and all other features needed to serve that portion of the total development (see sections 504.02 and 504.06). prior to approval for construction of any one stage an engineering stage plan shall be submitted to and approved by the city engineer. this plan shall address site grading erosion control stormwater management internal traffic circulation and any other design elements required by the city engineer. in approving a stage plan the planning commission or planning staff may specify certain site improvements to be provided at a percentage rate exceeding that of construction of the overall development. these items may be elements of engineering design or requirements of this ordinance. such improvements include but are not limited to parking drainage facilities erosion control measures landscaping and bufferyards. where the applicant has agreed to provide off-site improvements such as traffic signals turn lanes and sewer lines the city engineer may require such improvements to be in place upon completion of any stage of the development. b. variance. those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the board of zoning adjustment. this shall include existing development sites

or from cdd or ddh to r shall be permitted except upon a specific and documented finding that: 1. a change in demand which significantly (by a factor of at least 25 percent) alters the development potential of the land has occurred such as: (a) a significant change in migration patterns family size or birth rate since the last amendment of the cdd or ddh or (b) a major change such as the construction of a major road the installation of a sewer line or the provision of a formerly unavailable water supply which significantly alters the suitability of an area for development. ix-6 2. an area designated as a cdd or ddh has been precluded from development by unanticipated long term events such as the non-provision of a sewer plant or interceptor or a sewer ban and that said area constitutes a significant part of the total amount of the planned cdd or ddh. b. no rezoning of land to the urban core (uc) district shall be permitted except upon a specific and documented finding that: 1. marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities of an urban core district that cannot be provided by the district planned and mapped as urban core on the official zoning map and 2.

have adverse impacts on their economic viability and 3. traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed urban core development will not have adverse impacts on the level of service of arterial roads whether in incorporated or unincorporated areas within a two (2) mile radius of the site proposed for rezoning. c. no rezoning of land to the urban neighborhood (un-e un-w and un-s) districts shall be permitted except on a specific and documented finding that: 1. marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities and uses of the urban neighborhood (un-e un-w and un-s) districts that cannot

rezoning of land to the industrial (i) district shall be permitted except on a specific and documented finding that: 1. there is an inadequate supply of land zoned for these uses or the proposed use cannot be accommodated by those sites due to lack of transportation water or sewer or that the market area to be served by the proposed use cannot be efficiently served by the geographical location of the existing industrial district. 2. roads floodplains or other existing or planned features will insure sufficient buffering to protect surrounding land and uses from the negative impacts of the proposed industrial use. e. if all owners in an existing subdivision or proposed subdivision located in any r cdd ddh or rdd district petition the city council for a neighborhood conservation district

required public services. section 907. variances. 907.01. purpose. the purpose of this section is to empower the board of zoning adjustment to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this ordinance. it is expected that the granting of variances will be rare  however a variance may be appropriate where by reason of exceptional narrowness shallowness or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property the strict application of any regulation enacted under this ordinance would result in peculiar exceptional and undue hardship on the owner of such property. those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the board of zoning adjustment. this shall include existing development sites proposed for expansion or reconfiguration which are nonconforming to any requirement of this ordinance. the site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the variance request but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved. 907.02. application. any property owner may apply to the board of zoning adjustment for a variance using forms to be obtained from the planning department at least 15 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board. 907.03. standards for variances. the board of zoning adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict application of the provision of this ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards are satisfied. in general the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this ordinance shall be sparingly exercised. it is the intent of this ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property as intended by the zoning ordinance. any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. the applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. in particular the applicant shall establish and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and standards listed below: ix-8 a. the granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. b. the granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use which is not permitted in the district. c. there must be proof of unique circumstances: there must exist special circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the district and which circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building. d. there must be proof of unnecessary hardship. it is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted. furthermore the hardship complained of cannot be self-created  nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions  it must result from the application of this ordinance  it must be suffered directly by the property in question  and evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered. e. that the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the board of zoning adjustment is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose. f. that the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property substantially increase the congestion in the public streets increase the danger of fire endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent neighborhood. g. that the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands structures or buildings in the same district. the board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies. 907.04. standards for variances applicable to the airport. any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations of this section may apply to the auburn board of zoning adjustment for a variance from such regulations. applications for variances shall follow the same procedure for other variances. the application for a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation administration (faa) and the airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe efficient use of navigable airspace. a. criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance. where the faa has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would exceed an obstruction standard of 14 cfr part 77 the board of adjustment may grant an airport obstruction variance for a proposed development. such a variance may be granted if the board determines that: 1. the literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest (i.e. the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace without adverse impact to surrounding environs) ix-9 2. granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation. 3. granting the variance will do substantial justice. 4. the variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations. all variances shall be subject to conditions and terms as recommended by the faa. b. the following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be approved: 1. a condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an obstruction in accordance with the standards of faa advisory circular number 70/7460-1k as it may be amended. where such marking or lighting is required such requirement shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (c.o.) for the affected structure. 2. the faa must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid. 3. consideration shall be given to: a. the nature of the terrain and height (height per   512.02) of existing structures. b. public and private interests and investments. c. the character of flying operations and planned development of airports. d. faa designated federal airways. e. whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport. f. technological advances. g. the safety of persons on the ground and in the air. h. land use density. i. the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. j. the cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or proposed structures identified in the city of auburn. k. faa determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the faa. l. comments and recommendations from the airport. m. other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts. obstruction marking and lighting. any permit or variance granted may if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense to install operate and maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. ix-10 907.05 public hearing. upon application the board of zoning adjustment shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed variance to be held ten (10) days after a public notice has been published in the local newspaper after
