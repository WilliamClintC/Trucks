The provisions of this chapter apply unless more stringent requirements of an ordinance or law are specifically applicable to a particular body. It is the intent of the City Council that notice given of the meetings of public bodies always meet the minimum requirements of the State statute but that a reasonable effort should be made to exceed the minimum statutory requirements. This chapter applies to notice of meetings of the City Council and all commissions, boards, committees, subcommittees, task forces and any sub-unit of the foregoing public bodies of the City, whether meeting in a formal or informal meeting. The failure to give the notice provided for under this chapter does not invalidate or otherwise affect any action or decision of a public body of the City; however, this sentence does not change the consequences of failing to give the minimum notice required under State statute. Notice will ordinarily be given by the City Clerk. The presiding officer or the person or persons calling a meeting are responsible for notifying the City Clerk of meetings in sufficient time for the Clerk to publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.

       "  'Text': 'Purpose.  a.\\xa0The proper functioning of democratic government requires ethical behavior by public officials. Ethics involves the commitment to take individual responsibility in creating a government that has the trust and respect of its citizens. The purpose of this chapter is to set reasonable standards of conduct for City officials and the City Manager so that the public may be assured that its trust in such persons is well placed and that the City officials and the City Manager themselves are aware of the standards of conduct demanded.  b.\\xa0However, recognizing that Homer is a small community, with a limited number of people interested in serving as community leaders, it is not the intent of this chapter to set unreasonable barriers that will serve only to deter aspirants from public service.  c.\\xa0This chapter also defines conflict of interest and partiality, the standards stating when and to whom it applies, and the procedures for declaration and the proper action of the body when possible conflicts and partiality arise.  d.\\xa0This chapter is also intended to establish a process which will ensure that complaints or inquiries regarding the conduct of City officials and the City Manager are resolved in the shortest practicable time in order to protect the rights of the public at large and the rights of the City and the City Manager.  e.\\xa0The City Council intends this code to be interpreted to promote fair, honest, and impartial dealings with members of the public, to ensure proper use of City resources, and to avoid conflicts of interest.  f.\\xa0This chapter does not create or prevent a private cause of action against any person, City official, or the City Manager.

If a person participates in the meeting telephonically without a ruling from the Council, it shall be deemed to be with the approval of such participation by the Council, and all actions taken by the Council with the participation of all such persons are valid.  If telephonic participation is interrupted due to poor connectivity that hinders the active participation of a member in the meeting the Mayor will request a brief recess to allow the person an attempt to reestablish a connection. If the person cannot reestablish a clear connection after a recess, the Mayor shall call for a vote of the Council on whether to terminate telephonic participation. Prior to the vote, the Mayor or Council members may make such inquiries as necessary to make a decision. If a majority of the Council votes to terminate telephonic participation, the record will indicate such and the member participating telephonically shall not be called upon to comment or vote. The Council’s determination is final and not subject to veto or appeal.  d.\\xa0Subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not apply to special meetings or emergency meetings of the City Council called under HCC 1.14.030 and 1.14.050. A Council member or Mayor who requests to participate in a special or emergency meeting of the City Council must notify the City Clerk before the time scheduled for the start of the meeting. The Clerk will notify the Mayor and Council no later than the commencement of the meeting.

A record shall be kept in the registration book in the space provided of the name of the person who offered to vote but who actually did not vote, and a brief statement of explanation. The signing of the register constitutes a declaration by the voter that he is qualified to vote. If any election official present believes that the voter is not qualified, he shall immediately question the voter according to the procedure outlined in subsection (i)(1) of this section. If the voter’s polling place is in question, a voter shall be allowed to vote, and any election official shall consider the ballot as a questioned ballot.  d.\\xa0When the voter is qualified to vote, the election judge shall give him an official ballot.  e.\\xa0Each voter shall retire alone to a booth or private area to mark his ballot. If a voter is blind or otherwise physically unable to mark his ballot alone, he may request assistance and it may be permitted pursuant to AS 15.15.240.

In all cases the ballot shall be deposited in the ballot box by the voter himself, in the presence of the election judge, unless the voter requests the judge to deposit the ballot on his behalf.  f.\\xa0If a voter improperly marks or otherwise damages a ballot, he shall return it to the election officials, concealing the manner in which it is marked, and shall request a new ballot. The election officials shall record and retain the ballot number and destroy the spoiled ballot. A new ballot shall be issued to the voter. A voter may request replacement of a spoiled ballot no more than three times.  g.\\xa0Prohibiting the Count of Exhibited Ballots. No election official may allow a ballot to be placed in the ballot box which he knows to have been unlawfully exhibited by the voter. A ballot unlawfully exhibited shall be recorded and treated as a spoiled ballot.  h.\\xa0Fifteen minutes before closing the polls, the time remaining before such closure shall be proclaimed. When the polls are closed for the purposes of voting, that fact shall likewise be proclaimed and thereafter no ballot shall be issued except to those voters who were present and waiting their turn to go through the voting procedure at the time prescribed for closing the polls.  i.\\xa0Questioned Ballot Procedure.  1.\\xa0Every elected official shall question, and every watcher and other person qualified to vote in the precinct may question a person attempting to vote if the questioner has good reason to suspect that the questioned person is not qualified to vote. All questions regarding the person’s qualifications to vote shall be made in writing, setting forth the reason for the challenge. A questioned person, before voting, shall provide the information required to vote a questioned ballot and shall subscribe to an oath and affidavit, provided by the Clerk on the questioned voter oath and affidavit envelope, attesting to the fact that in each particular case the person meets all the qualifications of a voter, that he is not disqualified, and that he has not voted previously at the same election. After the questioned person has taken the oath and signed the affidavit, the person may vote. If the questioned person refuses to provide the information required to vote a questioned ballot or refuses to take the oath or sign the affidavit, the person may not vote.  2.\\xa0A questioned voter shall vote his ballot in the same manner as prescribed for other voters.

       "  'Text': 'Review of election documents by Canvass Board.  a.\\xa0The Clerk shall, subject to confirmation of the City Council, appoint a Canvass Board of as many members as required to accomplish the canvass in reasonable time. All members of the election Canvass Board, before entering upon their duties, must subscribe to the oath required of all public officers by the Constitution of the State of Alaska in the manner prescribed by the Clerk. The Canvass Board will review the preliminary certificates of election and all official documents of the precinct election boards and the counting center boards.  b.\\xa0Not later than the Monday following each election, the Canvass Board shall meet in public session and canvass all election returns. The Canvass Board may be recessed from day to day, but not more than three such recesses. In full view of those present, the election Canvass Board shall judge the applicability of absentee and questioned ballots, shall open and tally those accepted, and shall compile the total votes cast in the election. The canvass of ballots counted by the counting center shall be accomplished by reviewing the tallies of the recorded vote to check for mathematical error by comparing totals with the counting center logs and certificates of results. All obvious errors found by the election canvass in the transfer of totals from the precinct tally sheets to the precinct certificate of results shall be corrected by the Canvass Board. A mistake which has been made in precinct returns from the tallies to the certificate of results empowers the Canvass Board to recommend a recount of the results of the precinct or precincts for that portion of the returns in question.  c.\\xa0To be counted in the election, an absentee ballot by mail must be postmarked by midnight of election day and received by the Clerk before the canvass. Envelopes of absentee ballots by mail received after that time shall not be opened, but shall be marked “invalid” with the date and hour of receipt noted thereon, and shall be retained with other ballots of the election. An absentee ballot that is returned by electronic transmission must be received by the Clerk not later than 8:00 p.m. on election day in order to be counted. When the Clerk receives a completed absentee ballot by electronic transmission, the Clerk will remove the ballot portion of the transmission from the portion that identifies the voter; place the ballot portion in a secrecy sleeve and seal the secrecy sleeve; place the sealed secrecy sleeve in an envelope of the type used for absentee ballots returned by mail and seal that envelope; attach the voter identification portion to the outer envelope; and forward the sealed outer envelope to the Canvass Board.  d.\\xa0Questioned and absentee ballots shall be counted as follows: No questioned or absentee ballot by mail shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature, or if the voter fails to enclose his marked ballot inside the small envelope or secrecy sleeve provided. No absentee ballot by electronic transmission shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, or if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature. The Clerk or a member of the election Canvass Board may challenge the name of an absentee voter if he has good reason to suspect that the voter is not qualified to vote, is disqualified, or has already voted at the same election. The person making the questioned ballot shall specify the basis of the challenge for the record. The Canvass Board, by majority vote, may refuse to accept the challenge and count the ballot of a person properly challenged. If the ballot is refused, the Clerk shall notify the challenged voter by letter within four weeks of the canvass. All rejected ballots shall be enclosed in a separate envelope and shall be labeled “rejected ballots” retained with other materials of the election. If the ballot is not rejected, the large envelope shall be opened, the small inner envelope or secrecy sleeve shall be placed in a container and mixed with other blank absentee ballot envelopes, or in the case of counting questioned ballots with other blank questioned ballot envelopes, the mixed small blank envelopes or secrecy sleeves shall be drawn from the container, opened, and the ballots counted according to the rules of determining properly marked ballots.

To be entitled to such a hearing, your written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (a) within 5 workdays after you learned that your vehicle was impounded or was missing; or (b) within 15 workdays after the city mailed notice to the vehicle’s registered owner that the vehicle had been impounded; whichever occurs first. If you fail to make a timely request for a hearing you will lose all right to challenge the sufficiency of the basis for impoundment.  If timely requested, the hearing must be held within 48 hours after the filing of your written demand, not including Saturdays, Sundays, and city holidays. A determination that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for impounding your vehicle will require the release of the vehicle to you without your having to pay the towing and storage fees, or will entitle you to a refund if you have already paid the fees.

The hearing officer shall be someone other than the persons who will direct the impounding and storage of the vessel.

The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vessel. The Harbormaster shall carry the burden of establishing that there is probable cause to impound the vessel in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision and reasons therefor shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the owner of the vessel if such owner is not the person requesting the hearing. The hearing officer’s decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding connection with the impound in question and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final and may only be appealed to the Superior Court. Failure of the owner or operator to request or attend a scheduled pre-impoundment hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right of such hearing.  d.\\xa0The hearing officer shall only determine that as to the vessel in question either that there is probable cause to impound the vessel or that there is no such probable cause. In the event that the hearing officer determines that there is no probable cause, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the owner or operator and to the Harbormaster. Upon receipt of such certificate of probable cause, the Harbormaster may proceed with impoundment and disposition of the vessel by removal, sale or destruction as authorized by this title.  e.\\xa0Any vessel impounded shall be held by the City for a period of not less than 30 days during which the City shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the City a notice describing the vessel in general terms, the name and/or number, if any, the name and address of the owner, or operator, if known, or if not known shall so state the location of the vessel and the intention of the City to sell the same at public auction, on a day and at a place and time certain, not less than 10 days prior to the sale, for cash to the highest and best bidder. At any time prior to the auction, the owner or operator may redeem the vessel by cash payment of all City charges against the vessel.  f.\\xa0The minimum acceptable bid shall be a sum equal to the City’s charges against the vessel. The proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the cost of sale, then to accrued stall license fees and charges, service fees, storage charges, attorney fees and costs, and other expenses provided for in this title, and the balance, if any, shall be held in trust by the City for the owner of the vessel to claim; and if not claimed within one year, the balance shall be deposited into the small boat harbor facilities fund. Upon the sale being made, the City shall make and deliver its bill of sale, without warranty, conveying the vessel to the buyer.  g.\\xa0If at the public sale there are no bidders for the vessel, the City may destroy, sell at private sale or otherwise dispose of the vessel.

An order of impoundment shall identify the vessel, state the reasons for impoundment, and be dated and signed by the Harbormaster or his authorized designee. An impounded vessel may be immediately towed or otherwise removed upon the order of the Harbormaster. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the City from using alternatives to impoundment, including without limitation removal or other means to abate a nuisance.  c.\\xa0When action is taken to impound, remove, or otherwise abate a nuisance vessel, notice of such action shall be placed on the vessel if possible, and within six hours a copy of the notice shall be personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail addressed to the owner of the vessel. The notice shall include the following substantive provisions:  ATTENTION: The vessel _____________ has been impounded/removed/abated by the City of Homer harbormaster as a public nuisance for the following reasons: __________________________________________________________________  As the owner of the vessel you have the following options (those that apply are checked):  ____ The vessel has been impounded and you may recover possession of the vessel by paying to the person having custody of the vessel the towing, storage, and other charges that may have accrued.

You may direct any inquiries to the City of Homer harbormaster.  ____ The following action has been taken, and any option you may have is described below: _________________________________  If you believe the vessel was improperly impounded, removed, or otherwise abated, you may:  (i)\\xa0In the case of an impoundment, recover possession of the vessel by paying any towing, storage, or other charges that have accrued, and you may claim a refund or reimbursement by filing a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether the harbormaster had a sufficient factual and legal basis to impound the vessel; or  (ii)\\xa0In the case of an impoundment, you may demand return of the vessel without paying the towing, storage, or other charges by filing a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether the harbormaster had a sufficient factual and legal basis to impound the vessel; or  (iii)\\xa0You may in any other case file a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether the harbormaster had a sufficient factual and legal basis to impound, remove, or abate the vessel.  To be entitled to such a hearing, your written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (a) within 5 workdays after you learned that your vessel was impounded, removed, or otherwise abated or (b) within 15 workdays after the City mailed notice to the vessel owner of the action taken, whichever is earlier. If you fail to make a timely request for a hearing you will lose all right to challenge the sufficiency of the basis for the action taken.  If timely requested, the hearing must be held within 48 hours after the filing of your written demand, not including, Saturdays, Sundays, and city holidays, unless you waive your right to a speedy hearing. A determination that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for the action taken will require the release of the vessel to the owner without payment of the towing, storage, or other accrued charges, or it will entitle the owner to a refund or reimbursement if the charges were already paid.  A hearing may be demanded by filing the appropriate form with the City Clerk at Homer City Hall between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on any day other than Saturday, Sunday and city holidays.

If the hearing officer determines there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for the action taken, the Harbormaster may proceed to dispose of the vessel by sale according to HCC 10.04.120(e) through (g), or the Harbormaster may destroy or otherwise dispose of the vessel without sale if he makes a good faith determination that the value of the vessel does not exceed the costs of towing, storage, sale, and other harbor charges accrued against the vessel.
