have developed or will develop more in keeping with conventional or traditional neighborhood development principles  2) preserve and enhance the character of the downtown and established surrounding neighborhoods  and 3) provide development standards that are more reflective of the city s existing or planned character. b. general characteristics of traditional and conventional zones unless otherwise stated or modified through planned unit developments new development occurring within the city shall be compatible with the general characteristics of the area in which it is located. 1) traditional zone portions of the city designated as traditional zones typically include development with the following characteristics: a) a modified grid street system with a prevalent use of alleys and use of cul-de-sac streets only where topography or other natural constraints exist  b) lots with variable sizes widths and orientations in proximity to one another along with the provision of formal open spaces  c) human-scaled buildings with high quality exterior materials located within proximity or adjacent to the primary streets they front d) pedestrian and transit orientation with widespread provision of on-street parking and off-street surface parking areas located beside or behind buildings  and e) integrated residential and nonresidential land uses located in the same building or in proximity to one another without extensive buffering. 2) conventional zones portions of the city designated as conventional zones typically include development with the following characteristics: 3-2 a) curvilinear streets with some cul-de-sacs and alleys serving narrow lots or areas subject to environmental constraints b) lots with relatively uniform widths and sizes along with formal and informal open space areas  c) both pedestrian and automobile-oriented streetscapes including some lots fronted by surface parking lots located between the street and the building they serve  d) nonresidential developments typically set back from the streets they front and extended in strip form along streets  and e) segregation of different land uses into groups of similar type separated from other types by buffering and location. c. location 1) the geographic extents of traditional and conventional zones shall be depicted on the zoning map. all lots in the city shall have a

      "{'Section': '6.1.8', 'Text': '. transitional features a. purpose and intent. transitional features are architectural elements or site aspects used to provide a transition between land uses subdivisions and sites in an effort to mitigate conflicts and to provide design compatibility. it is the intent of these standards to: 1) blend new development with existing development form and pattern 2) reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion form or architecture 3) limit the excessive consumption of available land though the utilization of large vegetated buffers 4) limit interruptions in vehicular and pedestrian connections created by efforts to segregate uses  and 5) establish or maintain vibrant pedestrian-oriented areas where differing uses can operate in proximity to one another. b. applicability 1) transitional features shall be required: a) when design compatibility cannot be achieved between land uses lots or structures  or b) between lots or uses within a single mixed-use development located in either traditional or conventional zones. 2) in conventional zones the drt may require the use of transitional features in addition to the use of a buffer in accordance with the standards in section 6.2.6 where such transitional features are necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion form or architecture. if the applicant disagrees with the decision of the drt regarding the use of transitional features the applicant may appeal the decision planning commission and/or council depending on the type of application. 3) in traditional zones the drt may require the use of a buffer in-lieu of or in addition to the use of a transitional feature where such buffer is necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion form or architecture. if the applicant disagrees with the decision of the drt regarding the use of buffers or transitional features the applicant may appeal the decision to planning commission and/or council depending on the type of application. c. standards. in areas where existing blocks or 500 ft long frontages including the subject property are at least 75% developed and a transition between different land uses or buildings differing in scale mass height proportion setbacks form or architecture is needed the following approaches shall be used subject to the approval of the zoning official and the building department to establish a transition between uses and buildings: 1) for differing uses use setbacks that are within 25 percent of the average setbacks for existing uses on the same block face provided no new use is closer to the right-of-way than the closest existing principal structure 2) in residential districts or developments (no differing uses) no building shall be set back more or located closer to the street than the average of the setbacks of the existing dwellings on the same side of the street within the same block or two hundred fifty (250) feet each side thereof whichever is less. 6-8 figure 6-2: the new construction (outlined in red) on the right demonstrates appropriate average setbacks. the dwelling outlined in red on the left has a front setback that is too deep. 3) use lot widths that are within 40 percent of the average lot width for existing lots on the same block 4) ensure the perceived fa ade width and height on fa ades of adjacent structures and structures on opposing sides of a street are consistent with each other such that neither fa ade exceeds the other s dimensions by more than 25 percent figure 6-3: ensuring similar fa ade height and width dimensions of opposing fa ades can be an effective means of establishing a transition between uses. 5) graduate building height scale and mass through utilization of any of the following methods: a) building step-backs to reduce the bulk of a building s upper floors sec. 6.1.8.c cont. 6-9 b) dividing buildings into smaller parts including detached buildings to reduce effective visual bulk and to maintain the scale and rhythm of the existing pattern of development c) sight lines or angular planes to gauge the appropriate building height necessary to achieve a steady incremental transition  or d) other techniques to break up the scale of a building to complement existing development patterns as approved by the drt or the department of neighborhood services. figure 6-4: step-backs in building heights between different use types can be an effective transitional element. 6) use similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows doors awnings arcades pilasters cornices wall offsets building materials and other building articulations included on the lower intensity use as depicted in figure 6-7. figure 6-5: the example on the bottom demonstrates effective use of transition features. 7) locate off-street parking loading service and utility areas in a manner consistent with similar site features on surrounding sites. when adjacent to residential areas off-street parking loading service and utility areas shall be strategically located to mitigate disturbance to nearby residents. additionally loading and service areas shall not front a street and shall be screened in accordance with subsections 6.4.5 perimeter landscape standards and 6.4.9 screening 8) prevent incompatible exterior lighting or sources of audible noise or disturbance from building fa ades facing lower intensity uses 9) prevent abrupt changes in roof form by allowing adjacent incompatible uses to use similar roof types slopes or arrangements sec. 6.1.8.c cont. 6-10 10) orient outdoor dining gathering areas and other site attributes such as vending machines away from adjacent residential uses 11) orient primary building fa ades directly across from opposing primary fa ades regardless of use type (as seen in figure 6-8)  and figure 6-6: organizing buildings so that the primary fa ades face one another can serve as a transitional feature when two different building types occupy opposing sides of a street. 12) when dealing with multi-building developments on one or more lots establish a continuum of use intensity where uses of moderate intensity (colored orange in figure 6-7) are sited between high-intensity uses (colored brown in figure 6-9) and low-intensity uses (colored yellow in figure 6-7) (e.g. office uses between retail and detached residential). figure 6-7: multi-building developments can be organized to concentrate the highest intensity uses in a single area and feather the intensity and density outwards from high intensity centers.', 'Zoning Location': 'AL_Athens'}\n",
