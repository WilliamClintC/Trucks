The provisions of this chapter apply unless more stringent requirements of an ordinance or law are specifically applicable to a particular body. It is the intent of the City Council that notice given of the meetings of public bodies always meet the minimum requirements of the State statute but that a reasonable effort should be made to exceed the minimum statutory requirements. This chapter applies to notice of meetings of the City Council and all commissions, boards, committees, subcommittees, task forces and any sub-unit of the foregoing public bodies of the City, whether meeting in a formal or informal meeting. The failure to give the notice provided for under this chapter does not invalidate or otherwise affect any action or decision of a public body of the City; however, this sentence does not change the consequences of failing to give the minimum notice required under State statute. Notice will ordinarily be given by the City Clerk. The presiding officer or the person or persons calling a meeting are responsible for notifying the City Clerk of meetings in sufficient time for the Clerk to publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. [Ord. 89-1(A) §\\xa02, 1989].\\n\\n\\n1.14.020 Notice – Regular meetings.\\n\\nNotice of regular meetings of a public body of the City may be given by the adoption by the City Council of an ordinance or resolution setting out the days of each month and the time and place of the regular meetings of the body. In addition to, or instead of, notice given by ordinance or resolution, notice of a regular meeting may be given by publication once in a newspaper of a general circulation not less than three days before the date of the meeting. [Ord. 89-1(A) §\\xa02, 1989].\\n\\n\\n1.14.030 Notice – Special meetings.\\n\\nNotice of special meetings of any public body of the City may be given by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation at least three days before the date of the meeting or as provided in HCC 1.14.040. [Ord. 89-1(A) §\\xa02, 1989].\\n\\n\\n1.14.040 Alternate notice – Special meetings.\\n\\nInstead of the published notice provided for under HCC 1.14.030, notice may be given by:\\n\\na.\\xa0Broadcast by local radio at least twice a day for three consecutive days before the day of the meeting or for two consecutive days before the day of the meeting plus the day of the meeting. [Ord. 89-1(A) §\\xa02, 1989].\\n\\n\\n1.14.050 Notice – Emergency and urgent meetings.\\n\\nIf the presiding officer or the members of a body calling a special meeting determine that an emergency exists or that a situation requiring action or consideration by the body is required before the notice provided for under HCC 1.14.030 can be given, the standards of HCC 1.14.030 may be relaxed, but notice of the meeting should be broadcast as soon as possible and be repeated at least two additional times before the meeting. [Ord. 89-1(A) §\\xa02, 1989].\\n\\n\\n1.14.060 Notice – Adjourned meetings.\\n\\nIf a public body of the City is unable to complete the work on its agenda at a regular or special meeting, it may adjourn the meeting to another time or day prior to the next regular meeting of the body for the sole purpose of completing the work on its agenda. The day and time to which to adjourn shall be fixed by the adoption of a motion at or prior to adjournment of the regular or special meeting. At the adjourned meeting the body shall take up its work at the point where it was interrupted in the order of business. No further notice of the adjourned meeting is required but it is recommended that if time permits notice of the adjourned meeting be broadcast by local radio as soon as possible and be repeated two additional times before the meeting. [Ord. 92-42 §\\xa01, 1992].\\n\\n\\n1.14.070 Notice – Work sessions.\\n\\nA work session is a special meeting of a public body of the City called to enable the body to devote special time and effort to one or more enumerated subjects. The body may discuss and consider suggestions concerning the subject of the session, and take public input if it so desires, but it shall take no formal action.

All members of the election Canvass Board, before entering upon their duties, must subscribe to the oath required of all public officers by the Constitution of the State of Alaska in the manner prescribed by the Clerk. The Canvass Board will review the preliminary certificates of election and all official documents of the precinct election boards and the counting center boards.\\n\\nb.\\xa0Not later than the Monday following each election, the Canvass Board shall meet in public session and canvass all election returns. The Canvass Board may be recessed from day to day, but not more than three such recesses. In full view of those present, the election Canvass Board shall judge the applicability of absentee and questioned ballots, shall open and tally those accepted, and shall compile the total votes cast in the election. The canvass of ballots counted by the counting center shall be accomplished by reviewing the tallies of the recorded vote to check for mathematical error by comparing totals with the counting center logs and certificates of results. All obvious errors found by the election canvass in the transfer of totals from the precinct tally sheets to the precinct certificate of results shall be corrected by the Canvass Board. A mistake which has been made in precinct returns from the tallies to the certificate of results empowers the Canvass Board to recommend a recount of the results of the precinct or precincts for that portion of the returns in question.\\n\\nc.\\xa0To be counted in the election, an absentee ballot by mail must be postmarked by midnight of election day and received by the Clerk before the canvass. Envelopes of absentee ballots by mail received after that time shall not be opened, but shall be marked “invalid” with the date and hour of receipt noted thereon, and shall be retained with other ballots of the election. An absentee ballot that is returned by electronic transmission must be received by the Clerk not later than 8:00 p.m. on election day in order to be counted. When the Clerk receives a completed absentee ballot by electronic transmission, the Clerk will remove the ballot portion of the transmission from the portion that identifies the voter; place the ballot portion in a secrecy sleeve and seal the secrecy sleeve; place the sealed secrecy sleeve in an envelope of the type used for absentee ballots returned by mail and seal that envelope; attach the voter identification portion to the outer envelope; and forward the sealed outer envelope to the Canvass Board.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Questioned and absentee ballots shall be counted as follows: No questioned or absentee ballot by mail shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature, or if the voter fails to enclose his marked ballot inside the small envelope or secrecy sleeve provided. No absentee ballot by electronic transmission shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, or if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature. The Clerk or a member of the election Canvass Board may challenge the name of an absentee voter if he has good reason to suspect that the voter is not qualified to vote, is disqualified, or has already voted at the same election. The person making the questioned ballot shall specify the basis of the challenge for the record. The Canvass Board, by majority vote, may refuse to accept the challenge and count the ballot of a person properly challenged. If the ballot is refused, the Clerk shall notify the challenged voter by letter within four weeks of the canvass. All rejected ballots shall be enclosed in a separate envelope and shall be labeled “rejected ballots” retained with other materials of the election. If the ballot is not rejected, the large envelope shall be opened, the small inner envelope or secrecy sleeve shall be placed in a container and mixed with other blank absentee ballot envelopes, or in the case of counting questioned ballots with other blank questioned ballot envelopes, the mixed small blank envelopes or secrecy sleeves shall be drawn from the container, opened, and the ballots counted according to the rules of determining properly marked ballots.

For the purposes of this section the date of issuance is the date upon which the decision was mailed or delivered to the parties. [Ord. 16-42 §\\xa01, 2016].\\n\\n\\n10.04.120 Impounded vessel procedure.\\n\\na.\\xa0At least 10 days prior to impounding any vessel, the City shall cause to be posted on the vessel, in the Harbormaster’s office, the City Clerk’s office and on the bulletin board at the entrance of the United States Post Office notice of such action to be taken by the City. A copy of the notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator of the vessel at his last known address, which address shall be the same as that furnished in accordance with the regulations of this tariff.

The hearing officer shall be someone other than the persons who will direct the impounding and storage of the vessel. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be whether there is probable cause to impound the vessel in question. “Probable cause to impound” shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was a breach of Federal, local or municipal law or regulations, or any agreement entered into pursuant thereto, rendering the vessel subject to impoundment.

The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vessel. The Harbormaster shall carry the burden of establishing that there is probable cause to impound the vessel in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision and reasons therefor shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the owner of the vessel if such owner is not the person requesting the hearing. The hearing officer’s decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding connection with the impound in question and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final and may only be appealed to the Superior Court. Failure of the owner or operator to request or attend a scheduled pre-impoundment hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right of such hearing.\\n\\nd.\\xa0The hearing officer shall only determine that as to the vessel in question either that there is probable cause to impound the vessel or that there is no such probable cause. In the event that the hearing officer determines that there is no probable cause, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the owner or operator and to the Harbormaster. Upon receipt of such certificate of probable cause, the Harbormaster may proceed with impoundment and disposition of the vessel by removal, sale or destruction as authorized by this title.\\n\\ne.\\xa0Any vessel impounded shall be held by the City for a period of not less than 30 days during which the City shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the City a notice describing the vessel in general terms, the name and/or number, if any, the name and address of the owner, or operator, if known, or if not known shall so state the location of the vessel and the intention of the City to sell the same at public auction, on a day and at a place and time certain, not less than 10 days prior to the sale, for cash to the highest and best bidder. At any time prior to the auction, the owner or operator may redeem the vessel by cash payment of all City charges against the vessel.\\n\\nf.\\xa0The minimum acceptable bid shall be a sum equal to the City’s charges against the vessel. The proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the cost of sale, then to accrued stall license fees and charges, service fees, storage charges, attorney fees and costs, and other expenses provided for in this title, and the balance, if any, shall be held in trust by the City for the owner of the vessel to claim; and if not claimed within one year, the balance shall be deposited into the small boat harbor facilities fund. Upon the sale being made, the City shall make and deliver its bill of sale, without warranty, conveying the vessel to the buyer.\\n\\ng.\\xa0If at the public sale there are no bidders for the vessel, the City may destroy, sell at private sale or otherwise dispose of the vessel. The disposition is to be made without liability of the City, its employees or agents to the owner, master or any lien holder of the vessel.

Any person causing or permitting the nuisances to be placed as aforesaid shall remove the same and upon his failure to do so, the same may be removed or caused to be removed by the Harbormaster. When the Harbormaster has authorized such nuisances to be removed or stored commercially, all costs of such commercial removal or storage shall be paid by and recoverable from the person creating the nuisances and shall not excuse the person responsible therefor from prosecution hereunder. Any nuisance under this subsection may be impounded, disposed of by destruction, private or public sale, or by any other means deemed reasonable by the Harbormaster. Such disposition is to be made without liability of the City, its employees or agents to the owner, master or any lien holder of the nuisance.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Upon the Harbormaster’s written determination that a nuisance described in subsection (a) of this section exists that constitutes a clear and present danger to the public health, safety or general welfare, the nuisance may be summarily abated by the Harbormaster according to HCC 10.04.132 without prior notice.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Vessels declared a nuisance under subsection (a) of this section that do not constitute a clear and present danger to the public health, safety and general welfare may be moved, impounded, or disposed of according to the procedure provided in HCC 10.04.120.

An order of impoundment shall identify the vessel, state the reasons for impoundment, and be dated and signed by the Harbormaster or his authorized designee. An impounded vessel may be immediately towed or otherwise removed upon the order of the Harbormaster. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the City from using alternatives to impoundment, including without limitation removal or other means to abate a nuisance.\\n\\nc.\\xa0When action is taken to impound, remove, or otherwise abate a nuisance vessel, notice of such action shall be placed on the vessel if possible, and within six hours a copy of the notice shall be personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail addressed to the owner of the vessel.

A determination that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for the action taken will require the release of the vessel to the owner without payment of the towing, storage, or other accrued charges, or it will entitle the owner to a refund or reimbursement if the charges were already paid.\\n\\nA hearing may be demanded by filing the appropriate form with the City Clerk at Homer City Hall between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on any day other than Saturday, Sunday and city holidays.\\n\\n[Ord. 95-28 §\\xa02, 1995].\\n\\n\\n10.04.134 Nuisances – Post-removal hearing.\\n\\na.\\xa0If demand is timely made, the owner or person entitled to possession of the vessel is entitled to an administrative hearing to determine whether there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for the action to impound, remove, or otherwise abate the vessel. To be entitled to such a hearing, a written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (1) within five workdays after the owner or other person entitled to possession learned that the vessel was impounded, removed, or otherwise abated, or (2) within 15 workdays after the City mailed the notice required by HCC 10.04.132(c) to the vessel owner, whichever is earlier.

A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the owner of the vessel. The hearing officer’s decision in no way affects any criminal charges that may be pending.

If the hearing officer determines there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for the action taken, the Harbormaster may proceed to dispose of the vessel by sale according to HCC 10.04.120(e) through (g), or the Harbormaster may destroy or otherwise dispose of the vessel without sale if he makes a good faith determination that the value of the vessel does not exceed the costs of towing, storage, sale, and other harbor charges accrued against the vessel.

[Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.05.020 Measuring distances.\\n\\na.\\xa0When measuring distances for setbacks, structure dimensions, and similar measurements, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate lot line, edge of structure, or other object. These distances are not measured by following the topography of the land.\\n\\nb.\\xa0When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the shortest distance between the two objects, except as otherwise provided in this section or other sections of the zoning code.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Measurements involving a building are made to the closest wall of the building. Windowsills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, chimneys, bay windows up to 12 feet in length, and similar incidental architectural features that project not more than two feet into any required yard are not included in the measurement, and if they extend more than two feet into a required yard, that portion beyond two feet is included in the measurement. Paved terraces are not included in the measurement.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Covered porches, covered decks and covered entrances are included in a measurement involving a building. Unroofed porches, decks, landings and stairs are excluded from the measurement of front and rear yards only if no portion other than a light handrail extends higher than 16 inches above the finished grade.\\n\\ne.\\xa0Open fire escapes are excluded from the measurement of any required yard only if they project not more than four feet, six inches into a required yard.\\n\\nf.\\xa0Structures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.05.030 Measuring heights.\\n\\na.\\xa0When measuring height of a building, the following are included in the measurement: screening, parapets, mansards or similar structures.\\n\\nb.\\xa0When measuring height of a building, the following are excluded from the measurement:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Steeples, spires, belfries, cupolas and domes if not used for human occupancy, chimneys, ventilators, weather vanes, skylights, water tanks, bulkheads, monuments, flagpoles, wind energy systems, television and radio antennas, other similar features, and necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried above roof level.\\n\\n2.\\xa0Wireless communications equipment that does not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the building.\\n\\nc.\\xa0When determining building height on a sloping lot, building height shall be calculated as follows: more than 50 percent of the perimeter of the building shall meet the maximum building height requirements; the maximum elevation of the remainder of the building shall not exceed the elevation of the first portion nor add more than 12 feet of building height at any point.\\n\\nd.\\xa0When determining the height of a nonbuilding structure, such as a sign, fence, amateur radio tower, communications tower or wireless communications support structure, the height shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the structure at normal grade to the top of the highest part of the structure, excluding lightning rods. For this calculation, normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any fill, berm, mound, or excavation made for the purpose of locating or supporting the structure. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, structure height shall be calculated on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the structure is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the main building on the lot, whichever is lower. [Ord. 14-18(A)(S-2) §§\\xa02, 3, 2016; Ord. 09-34(A) §\\xa03, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.05.040 Measuring slopes.\\n\\nWhen calculating the slope of a lot, an average slope is used based on the elevations at the corners of the lot. The average slope of a lot, expressed as a percentage, is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill lot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the difference by the average distance between the two lot lines. The average elevation of the uphill or downhill lot line is calculated by adding the elevations at the ends of the lot line and dividing by two.

An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than the basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at HCC 21.41.220(a).\\n\\n“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes recreational vehicles, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include recreational vehicles, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.\\n\\n“One-hundred-year flood” (also called “regulatory flood,” “base flood” or “special flood hazard area”) (see “base flood”) means a flood of a magnitude which can be expected to occur on an average of once every 100 years. It is possible for this size flood to occur during any year, and possibly in successive years. It would have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Statistical analysis of available stream flow or storm records, or analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics of the watershed, or topography and storm characteristics are used to determine the extent and depth of the 100-year flood.\\n\\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area. See “area of special flood hazard.”\\n\\n“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, external dimensions of the building.\\n\\n“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including liquid or gas storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home that is principally above ground.\\n\\n“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.\\n\\n“Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Any project for improvement of a structure to correct violations that have been previously cited based on State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or\\n\\n2.\\xa0Any alteration of a “historic structure” listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”\\n\\n“Variance” means a grant of relief by the City from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.\\n\\n“Water-dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry, which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water because of the intrinsic nature of its operations. [Ord. 13-32 §\\xa01, 2013; Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.040 Basis for establishing flood hazard areas.\\n\\nThe areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for the Kenai Peninsula Borough and Incorporated Areas, Alaska,” dated October 20, 2016, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.

[Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.070 Development permit required.\\n\\nA development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within special flood hazard areas established in HCC 21.41.040. The permit shall be for all development as defined by HCC 21.41.030. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the City and shall include but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:\\n\\na.\\xa0Elevations to be determined by registered State land surveyors in relation to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88, the vertical datum used as a reference in the Flood Insurance Study for flood, ground, and structure elevations) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;\\n\\nb.\\xa0Elevation in relation to NAVD88 to which any structure has been floodproofed;\\n\\nc.\\xa0Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in HCC 21.41.220(b);\\n\\nd.\\xa0Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. [Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.080 Administration by Planning Department.\\n\\nThe Planning Department, acting under the direction of the City Planner, is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications and otherwise acting in accordance with its provisions.

[Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.100 Fee required.\\n\\nThe Planning Department shall charge fees for permits and variances. Fees shall be established by resolution of the Homer City Council to be paid by the applicant at the time that the floodplain development permit application or variance application is submitted. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.200 Standards – All flood hazard areas.\\n\\nIn all flood hazard areas, the following standards apply:\\n\\na.\\xa0Anchoring.\\n\\n1.\\xa0All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.\\n\\n2.\\xa0All manufactured homes must be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

No elevation certificate or variance is required for a development determined by the City to be an accessory structure.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Utilities.\\n\\n1.\\xa0All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;\\n\\n2.\\xa0New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and\\n\\n3.\\xa0On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Subdivision Proposals.\\n\\n1.\\xa0All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.\\n\\n2.\\xa0All proposed improvements such as water, sewer, natural gas, telephone and electrical facilities shall be located and constructed in a manner which will minimize damage in the event of a flood.\\n\\n3.\\xa0All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.\\n\\n4.\\xa0Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for all subdivision proposals located in unnumbered A or V Zones when the subdivision is planned to be 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.\\n\\n5.\\xa0It is the responsibility of the subdivider to provide all necessary information regarding flood protection measures at the time the preliminary plat is presented for consideration by the Planning Commission.\\n\\ne.\\xa0Review of Development Permits.\\n\\n1.\\xa0Where elevation data is not available, applications for development permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding.\\n\\n2.\\xa0The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, and other evidence where available. [Ord. 13-32 §\\xa03, 2013; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.220 Standards – Where base flood elevation data is provided.\\n\\nIn all flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in HCC 21.41.040 the following provisions are required:\\n\\na.\\xa0Residential Construction.\\n\\n1.\\xa0New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation.\\n\\n2.\\xa0Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:\\n\\na.\\xa0Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are to be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage.\\n\\nb.\\xa0A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.\\n\\nc.\\xa0The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices if they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.\\n\\nb.\\xa0Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Be floodproofed so that one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;\\n\\n2.\\xa0Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;\\n\\n3.\\xa0Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in HCC 21.41.090(d)(2);\\n\\n4.\\xa0Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standard for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (a)(2) of this section;\\n\\n5.\\xa0Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).\\n\\nc.\\xa0Manufactured Homes.

A recreational vehicle placed on a site within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s FIRM either must:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or\\n\\n2.\\xa0Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or\\n\\n3.\\xa0Meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. [Ord. 13-32 §\\xa04, 2013; Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.230 Standards – Floodways.\\n\\nLocated within flood hazard areas established in HCC 21.41.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to erosion potential and the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, the following provisions apply:\\n\\na.\\xa0All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.\\n\\nb.\\xa0If subsection (a) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of HCC 21.41.200 through 21.41.250. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.240 Standards – Shallow flooding areas.\\n\\nShallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:\\n\\na.\\xa0New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).\\n\\nb.\\xa0New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or\\n\\n2.\\xa0Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer as in HCC 21.41.220(b)(3).\\n\\nc.\\xa0Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes must guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.\\n\\nd.\\xa0A recreational vehicle placed on a site within AO Zones must either:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or\\n\\n2.\\xa0Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or\\n\\n3.\\xa0Meet the requirements of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.\\n\\ne.\\xa0A minimum of two openings on at least two different walls of the enclosure must be installed. The bottom of the openings must be no higher than one foot above grade. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.250 Standards – Coastal high hazard areas.\\n\\nLocated within areas of special flood hazard established in HCC 21.41.040 are coastal high hazard areas, designated as Zones V1-V30, VE or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all other provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:\\n\\na.\\xa0All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V1-V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is unavailable) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:\\n\\n1.\\xa0The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and\\n\\n2.\\xa0The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto are anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).\\n\\nb.\\xa0A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section.\\n\\nc.\\xa0The developer shall obtain and provide to the Planning Department the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in Zones V1-30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The Planning Department shall maintain a record of all such information.\\n\\nd.\\xa0All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.\\n\\ne.\\xa0All new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and\\n\\n2.\\xa0The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).\\n\\nf.\\xa0If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.\\n\\ng.\\xa0The use of fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited.\\n\\nh.\\xa0Manmade alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.\\n\\ni.\\xa0All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones V1-V30, V, and VE on the FIRM shall meet the standards of subsections (a) through (h) of this section and shall meet the requirements of HCC 21.41.220(c).\\n\\nj.\\xa0A recreational vehicle placed on a site within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the FIRM shall either:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or\\n\\n2.\\xa0Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or\\n\\n3.\\xa0Meet the requirements of HCC 21.41.070 and subsections (a) through (h) of this section.

[Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.320 Variances – Conditional approval.\\n\\nUpon consideration of the factors of HCC 21.41.310 and the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.330 Variances – Records and reports.\\n\\nThe Planning Department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.41.340 Variances – Conditions for granting.\\n\\na.\\xa0Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided HCC 21.41.310(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.\\n\\nb.\\xa0Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in HCC 21.41.300 through 21.41.340.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.\\n\\ne.\\xa0Variances shall only be issued upon:\\n\\n1.\\xa0A showing of good and sufficient cause;\\n\\n2.\\xa0A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and\\n\\n3.\\xa0A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.\\n\\nf.\\xa0Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods.

A planned unit development (PUD) is a device that allows a development to be planned and built as a unit, or as phased units, and permits flexibility and variation in many of the traditional controls related to density, land use, setback, open space and other design elements, and the timing and sequencing of the construction. A PUD may be applicable to either residential, commercial, noncommercial or industrial uses or a combination thereof. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.52.020 Uses allowed in PUDs.\\n\\na.\\xa0PUDs are allowed in a zoning district only when allowed by the code provisions specifically applicable to that district. A PUD may consist of residential, noncommercial, commercial or industrial uses or a combination thereof, subject to any limitations or exceptions provided in this title.\\n\\nb.\\xa0In every PUD and during every stage of development of the PUD, at least 60 percent of the uses in the PUD must be uses that are listed as permitted outright or conditionally within the zoning district in which it is located. To satisfy this standard, the PUD must satisfy all of the following tests:\\n\\n1.\\xa0The total of floor area plus exterior lot area occupied by uses listed as permitted outright or conditionally in the zoning district must be not less than 60 percent of the total of floor area plus exterior lot area occupied by all uses in the PUD; and\\n\\n2.\\xa0The tax assessed valuation of that portion of the structures in the PUD used for uses listed as permitted outright and conditionally in the zoning district must total not less than 60 percent of the total assessed valuation of all structures in the PUD.

[Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.52.050 Residential PUDs.\\n\\na.\\xa0A residential PUD (any planned unit development that includes any residential uses) shall comply with the requirements and conditions of this section. A residential PUD shall also comply with HCC 21.52.060 if commercial, noncommercial or industrial uses are included in the PUD.\\n\\nb.\\xa0Connections to public water and sewer utilities, if available, shall be provided as part of the PUD. If public water and sewer utilities are not available, systems provided must be approved by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Density.\\n\\n1.\\xa0Maximum floor area in the PUD shall not exceed 0.4 times the gross land area;\\n\\n2.\\xa0Total open area shall be at least 1.1 times the total floor area;\\n\\n3.\\xa0For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, open area shall not include areas used for parking or maneuvering incidental to parking or vehicular access. Open area may include walkways, landscaped areas, sitting areas, recreation space, and other amenities. All open area shall be suitably improved for its intended use but open area containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Common Open Space.\\n\\n1.\\xa0All or a portion of the open area may be set aside as common open space for the benefit, use and enjoyment of present and future residents of the development.\\n\\n2.\\xa0The development schedule that is part of the development plan must coordinate the improvement of the common open space with the construction of residential dwellings in the planned development.\\n\\n3.\\xa0For any areas to be held under any form of common ownership, a written description of the owner’s intentions for the creation of legally enforceable future maintenance provisions shall be submitted with the conditional use permit application. The description shall indicate whether membership of property owners in an association for maintenance of the common area will be mandatory.\\n\\ne.\\xa0Perimeter Requirements. If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy for uses adjacent to the PUD, the Commission may impose conditions to provide adequate privacy, including without limitation one or both of following requirements:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Structures located on the perimeter of the planned development must be set back a distance sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses;\\n\\n2.\\xa0Structures on the perimeter must be permanently screened by a fence, wall or planting or other measures sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses.\\n\\nf.\\xa0Dimensional Requirements. Dimensional requirements may be varied from the requirements of the district within which the PUD is located. All departures from those requirements will be evaluated against the following criteria:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Privacy. The minimum building spacing is one method of providing privacy within the dwelling unit. Where windows are placed in only one or two facing walls or there are no windows, or where the builder provides adequate screening for windows, or where the windows are at such a height or location to provide adequate privacy, the building spacing may be reduced.\\n\\n2.\\xa0Light and Air. The building spacing provides one method of ensuring that each room has adequate light and air. Building spacing may be reduced where there are no windows or very small window areas and where rooms have adequate provisions for light and air from another direction.\\n\\n3.\\xa0Use. Where areas between buildings are to be used as service yards for storage of trash, clotheslines or other utilitarian purposes for both buildings, then a reduction of building space permitting effective design of a utility space may be permitted. Kitchens and garages are suitable uses for rooms abutting such utility yards.\\n\\n4.\\xa0Building Configuration. Where building configuration is irregular so that the needs expressed in subsections (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are met by the building configuration, reduced building spacing may be permitted.\\n\\n5.\\xa0Front Yard. Where the PUD provides privacy by reducing traffic flow through street layouts such as cul-de-sacs, or by screening or planting, or by fencing the structure toward open space or a pedestrian way, or through the room layout, the right-of-way setback requirement may be reduced.\\n\\n6.\\xa0Lot Width. A minimum lot width is intended to prevent the construction of long, narrow buildings with inadequate privacy, light and air. There are situations as in cul-de-sacs, steep slopes or off-set lots where, because of lot configuration or topography, narrow or irregular lots provide the best possible design. Where the design is such that light, air and privacy can be provided, especially for living spaces and bedrooms, a narrower lot width may be permitted. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.52.060 Commercial, noncommercial and industrial PUDs.\\n\\na.\\xa0Any PUD that contains any commercial, noncommercial, or industrial use shall comply with the requirements and conditions of this section. If residential use is included in the PUD, it shall also comply with HCC 21.52.050.\\n\\n1.\\xa0For purposes of this section, a commercial use is defined as an occupation, employment, or enterprise that is carried on for profit that is not an industrial use.\\n\\n2.\\xa0For purposes of this section, an industrial use is defined as a use engaged in the processing or manufacturing of materials or products, including processing, fabrication, assembly, treatment, packaging, storage, sales or distribution of such products.\\n\\n3.\\xa0For purposes of this section a noncommercial use is a use that is neither residential, commercial nor industrial.\\n\\nb.\\xa0A planned unit development that includes commercial, noncommercial or industrial uses shall comply with the following requirements and conditions:\\n\\n1.\\xa0The PUD site shall have direct access to an arterial or collector street.\\n\\n2.\\xa0Utilities, roads and other essential services must be constructed, installed and available for the immediate use of occupants of the PUD.\\n\\n3.\\xa0The PUD shall be developed with a unified architectural treatment in exterior building materials, colors and design features.\\n\\nc.\\xa0If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy for uses adjacent to the PUD, the Commission may impose conditions to provide adequate privacy, including without limitation one or both of following requirements:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Structures located on the perimeter of the planned development must be set back a distance sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses;\\n\\n2.\\xa0Structures on the perimeter must be permanently screened by a fence, wall or planting or other measures sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Dimensional Requirements. Setbacks and distances between buildings within the development shall be at least equivalent to that required by the zoning district in which the PUD is located unless the applicant demonstrates that:\\n\\n1.\\xa0A better or more appropriate design can be achieved by not applying the provisions of the zoning district; and\\n\\n2.\\xa0Adherence to the dimensional requirements of the zoning district is not required in order to protect health, safety and welfare of the occupants of the development and the surrounding area.\\n\\ne.\\xa0The site development standards of HCC 21.50.030 shall be met. [Ord. 13-27 §\\xa017, 2013; Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.52.070 Time limit.\\n\\nAfter a PUD conditional use permit and development plan are approved by the Commission, construction of the planned unit development must begin within two years of the approval of the conditional use permit. The Commission may extend the time to begin construction by not more than two additional years for good cause shown. If construction is not begun within such time, including any extensions granted, the conditional use permit and development plan approvals lapse, and the conditional use permit and development plan must be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for re-approval. After a lapse of one year or more, a new conditional use permit application and PUD development plan cannot be re-approved and must be submitted to the Commission as a new application for complete reconsideration.

[Ord. 08-29, 2008].\\n\\n\\n21.74.020 Development activity plan standards.\\n\\nThe DAP shall provide for the control of stormwater discharges, the control of total suspended solids, and the control of other pollutants carried in runoff. The DAP shall address and satisfy each of the standards established in this section. These standards apply during construction and all other phases of development activity.\\n\\na.\\xa0Stabilization and Sediment Trapping. All exposed or disturbed soils with grades exceeding 10 percent and soils exposed to concentrated surface runoff flows, including soil stockpiles, shall be stabilized in a way that protects soil from the erosive forces of weather and flowing water. Applicable practices include, but are not limited to, the installation of silt fences, vegetative establishment, mulching, plastic covering, and the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved. No soils shall remain unstabilized for more than three days. At all times of the year, the contractor shall have sufficient materials, equipment and labor on site to stabilize and prevent erosion from all disturbed areas before initiating or continuing work.\\n\\nb.\\xa0Delineation of Clearing and Easement Limits. Clearing limits, setbacks, buffers, and sensitive or critical areas such as steep slopes, wetlands and riparian corridors shall be clearly identified in the DAP, marked in the field, and inspected by the City prior to commencement of land clearing activities.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Protection of Adjacent Properties. Adjacent properties shall be protected from sediment deposition by appropriate use of vegetative buffer strips, sediment barriers or filters, dikes or mulching, or by a combination of these measures and other appropriate methods.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Timing and Stabilization of Sediment Trapping Measures. Sediment ponds and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers and other approved methods intended to trap sediment on site shall be constructed as a first step. These methods shall be functional before additional land-disturbing activities take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall not remain unstabilized for more than three days.\\n\\ne.\\xa0Slope Stabilization. Cut and fill slopes shall be constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. Roughened soil surfaces are preferred to smooth surfaces. Interceptors should be constructed at the top of long, steep slopes that have significant areas above that contribute runoff. Concentrated runoff should not be allowed to flow down the face of a cut or fill slope unless contained within an adequate channel or pipe slope drain. Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane, adequate drainage or other protection should be provided. In addition, slopes should be stabilized in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\\n\\nf.\\xa0Controlling Off-Site Erosion. Properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be protected from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff from the development site by the implementation of appropriate methods to minimize adverse downstream impacts.\\n\\ng.\\xa0Stabilization of Conveyance Channels and Outlets. All temporary and permanent on-site conveyance channels shall be designed, constructed and stabilized to prevent erosion from the expected flow velocity from a two-year, three-hour duration storm for the post-development condition. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes and downstream reaches shall be provided at the outlets of all conveyance systems.\\n\\nh.\\xa0Storm Drain Inlet Protection. All storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that stormwater runoff shall not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment. After proper written application, the requirement for inlet protection may be waived by the City on a site-specific basis when the conveyance system downstream of the inlet discharges to an appropriate on-site sediment control method, including but not limited to sediment ponds or traps. The conveyance system will be adequately cleaned following site stabilization.\\n\\ni.\\xa0Underground Utility Construction. The construction of underground utility lines shall be limited, where feasible, to no more than 500 feet of open trench at any one time. Where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of the trench. Dewatering devices shall discharge to an appropriate sediment trap or pond, preceded by adequate energy dissipation, prior to runoff leaving the site.\\n\\nj.\\xa0Constructed Access Routes. Wherever construction vehicle routes intersect paved roads, provisions must be made to minimize the transport of sediment (mud) and debris onto the paved road by use of approved methods. If sediment or debris is transported onto a road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly, as a minimum, at the end of each day. Sediment or debris shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner.\\n\\nk.\\xa0Removal of Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Methods. All temporary erosion and sediment control methods shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary methods are no longer needed. Trapped sediment shall be removed or stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal of temporary methods shall be permanently stabilized. The removal of temporary erosion and sediment control methods may not be required for those projects, such as single-family developments, that will be followed by additional construction under a different permit. In these circumstances, the need for removing or retaining the measures will be evaluated on a site-specific basis.\\n\\nl.\\xa0Dewatering Construction Sites. Dewatering devices shall discharge into an appropriate sediment trap or pond designed to accept such a discharge, preceded by adequate energy dissipation, prior to runoff leaving the site.\\n\\nm.\\xa0Control of Pollutants Other Than Sediment on Construction Sites. All pollutants other than sediment that occur on site during construction shall be handled and legally disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of ground or surface waters. Pollutants of concern include, but are not limited to, fuels, lubricants, solvents, concrete by-products and construction materials.\\n\\nn.\\xa0Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control methods shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. The owner shall be responsible for assuring that any such facilities damaged during floods, storms or other adverse weather conditions are immediately returned to normal operating condition.\\n\\no.\\xa0Erosion Control. Erosion control design storm event facilities designed for the control of erosion and sedimentation shall be designed for the erosion and sedimentation control design storm event, defined as the two-year, three-hour duration storm.\\n\\np.\\xa0Changes in Site Topography.\\n\\n1.\\xa0The maximum surface gradient on any artificially created slope shall be two feet of horizontal run to one foot of vertical fall (2:1). This gradient may be increased to a steeper slope, if, in the judgment of the Director of Public Works, it has been demonstrated by the developer through engineering calculations performed by a qualified professional engineer that surface erosion at such a gradient can be controlled to that erosion rate equal to a properly stabilized 2:1 slope under the same conditions.\\n\\n2.\\xa0The developer shall, at all times, protect adjacent properties and public rights-of-way and easements from damage occurring during, or resulting from, grading operations. The developer shall restore public improvements damaged by the developer’s operations.\\n\\nq.\\xa0Correction of Defective Maintenance. If the developer or owner, or both, refuse or fail to adequately maintain and keep the erosion and sediment control facilities functional at all times, and the owner of the property is given seven days’ notice to perform the work necessary to make the facility functional and fails to do so, the City may use public funds to complete maintenance of the facilities at the cost of the developer and the property owner, who shall be jointly and severally liable for such costs.\\n\\nr.\\xa0Progress of Work. All work required or approved under this section shall proceed continuously to completion in an expeditious manner unless otherwise authorized by the Director of Public Works, with the intent that work may be halted, for example, due to weather conditions or the need to coordinate other construction on the project site.

In the absence thereof, all Commission or Board members or a hearing officer shall participate in the deliberation and voting process unless excused pursuant to other provisions of this chapter.\\n\\nb.\\xa0When a financial interest of a member of the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment is disclosed on the record, the remainder of the Commission or Board, respectively, shall determine whether the member should participate in the matter.

If it is not possible to obtain a quorum of the Planning Commission to hear an appeal without the participation of members disqualified by reason of a substantial financial interest, then all members who would be so disqualified shall nevertheless participate in the appeal, including deliberations and voting, and the decision rendered in such a case shall be valid notwithstanding the participation of such members. This subsection shall not apply if the matter can be postponed to a later date (not later than 75 days after the appeal record is prepared) when the body can obtain a quorum of members who are not disqualified by a substantial financial interest. \\n\\ne.\\xa0For purposes of hearing an appeal, a quorum of the Board is four members. If it is not possible to obtain a quorum of the Board to hear an appeal without the participation of members who have chosen to abstain or been disqualified by the Board due to substantial financial interest, bias or partiality, then the hearing shall be postponed and a hearing officer shall be appointed. A hearing officer appointed under this subsection shall conduct the rescheduled hearing no more than 60 days after the original hearing date except that the hearing officer may extend the hearing date for good cause shown.

All members of the election Canvass Board, before entering upon their duties, must subscribe to the oath required of all public officers by the Constitution of the State of Alaska in the manner prescribed by the Clerk. The Canvass Board will review the preliminary certificates of election and all official documents of the precinct election boards and the counting center boards.\\n\\nb.\\xa0Not later than the Monday following each election, the Canvass Board shall meet in public session and canvass all election returns. The Canvass Board may be recessed from day to day, but not more than three such recesses. In full view of those present, the election Canvass Board shall judge the applicability of absentee and questioned ballots, shall open and tally those accepted, and shall compile the total votes cast in the election. The canvass of ballots counted by the counting center shall be accomplished by reviewing the tallies of the recorded vote to check for mathematical error by comparing totals with the counting center logs and certificates of results. All obvious errors found by the election canvass in the transfer of totals from the precinct tally sheets to the precinct certificate of results shall be corrected by the Canvass Board. A mistake which has been made in precinct returns from the tallies to the certificate of results empowers the Canvass Board to recommend a recount of the results of the precinct or precincts for that portion of the returns in question.\\n\\nc.\\xa0To be counted in the election, an absentee ballot by mail must be postmarked by midnight of election day and received by the Clerk before the canvass. Envelopes of absentee ballots by mail received after that time shall not be opened, but shall be marked “invalid” with the date and hour of receipt noted thereon, and shall be retained with other ballots of the election. An absentee ballot that is returned by electronic transmission must be received by the Clerk not later than 8:00 p.m. on election day in order to be counted. When the Clerk receives a completed absentee ballot by electronic transmission, the Clerk will remove the ballot portion of the transmission from the portion that identifies the voter; place the ballot portion in a secrecy sleeve and seal the secrecy sleeve; place the sealed secrecy sleeve in an envelope of the type used for absentee ballots returned by mail and seal that envelope; attach the voter identification portion to the outer envelope; and forward the sealed outer envelope to the Canvass Board.\\n\\nd.\\xa0Questioned and absentee ballots shall be counted as follows: No questioned or absentee ballot by mail shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature, or if the voter fails to enclose his marked ballot inside the small envelope or secrecy sleeve provided. No absentee ballot by electronic transmission shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, or if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature. The Clerk or a member of the election Canvass Board may challenge the name of an absentee voter if he has good reason to suspect that the voter is not qualified to vote, is disqualified, or has already voted at the same election. The person making the questioned ballot shall specify the basis of the challenge for the record. The Canvass Board, by majority vote, may refuse to accept the challenge and count the ballot of a person properly challenged. If the ballot is refused, the Clerk shall notify the challenged voter by letter within four weeks of the canvass. All rejected ballots shall be enclosed in a separate envelope and shall be labeled “rejected ballots” retained with other materials of the election. If the ballot is not rejected, the large envelope shall be opened, the small inner envelope or secrecy sleeve shall be placed in a container and mixed with other blank absentee ballot envelopes, or in the case of counting questioned ballots with other blank questioned ballot envelopes, the mixed small blank envelopes or secrecy sleeves shall be drawn from the container, opened, and the ballots counted according to the rules of determining properly marked ballots.

An order of impoundment shall identify the vehicle, state the reasons for impoundment, and be dated and signed by a police officer or an authorized peace officer. An impounded vehicle may be immediately towed and removed to a safe place upon the order of a police officer or peace officer.\\n\\nc.\\xa0Upon impoundment, a notice of procedure options shall be placed on the vehicle, and within six hours a copy shall be personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail addressed to the owner of the vehicle. The notice shall state substantially as follows:\\n\\nATTENTION: Your vehicle has been impounded by the City of Homer. As the owner of an impounded vehicle, you have the following options:\\n\\n(A) You may recover possession of the vehicle by paying to the person having custody of the vehicle the towing and storage fees that may have accrued.\\n\\n(B) If you take issue with the impoundment of your vehicle, you may:\\n\\n(i) Recover possession of the vehicle by paying the towing and storage fees that have accrued to such person and claim a refund by filing a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for impounding your vehicle; or\\n\\n(ii) Demand (on a form provided by the city) an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for impounding your vehicle.\\n\\nTo be entitled to such a hearing, your written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (a) within 5 workdays after you learned that your vehicle was impounded or was missing; or (b) within 15 workdays after the city mailed notice to the vehicle’s registered owner that the vehicle had been impounded; whichever occurs first. If you fail to make a timely request for a hearing you will lose all right to challenge the sufficiency of the basis for impoundment.\\n\\nIf timely requested, the hearing must be held within 48 hours after the filing of your written demand, not including Saturdays, Sundays, and city holidays. A determination that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for impounding your vehicle will require the release of the vehicle to you without your having to pay the towing and storage fees, or will entitle you to a refund if you have already paid the fees.\\n\\nA hearing may be demanded by filing the appropriate form with the City Clerk at 491 E. Pioneer Avenue, Homer between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on any day other than Saturday, Sunday and city holidays.\\n\\n[Ord. 15-42 §\\xa04, 2015].\\n\\n\\n',\n",
